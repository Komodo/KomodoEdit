    patchtree.py -- applying sets of patches to source trees

    Module Usage:
        import patchtree
        patchtree.patch(<patchesdir>, <srcdir>, config=<config object>,
                        logDir=<logdir>, dryRun=<boolean>)
        patchtree.unpatch(<srcdir>, <logdir>, dryRun=<boolean>)
    
    Command Line Usage:
        python patchtree.py [<options>...] <srcdir> <patchesdir>...
    
    Options:
        -h, --help          Print this help and exit.
        -V, --version       Print this script's version and exit.
        -v, --verbose       Increase the verbosity of output.
        --dry-run           Go through motions but don't change anything.
        
        -c, --config <configfile>
                            Specify a Python configuration module to be
                            passed to __patchinfo__.py control files.
        -L, --log-dir <logdir>
                            Specify a log directory in which all patches
                            that are actually applied are placed.
        -R                  Reverse patch, i.e. backout previous patches.

    This module defines a system for applying sets of patches to source
    trees. Which patches are applied can be controlled by meta-data files --
    which themselves can run Python code to determine if a certain patch (or
    patches) should be applied. The details and cross-platform pains of
    applying patches is hidden. It is intelligent to know if the patch set is
    already applied. Applying the patch set is mostly atomic. Etc.


    Here is how it works. You specify a source directory and a number of
    patch directories (or files). Any directory may have a __patchinfo__.py
    Python module to control how that directory tree of patches is applied.
    That module may define any of the following special functions:
    
        def applicable(config)
            Should return true if this directory tree should be considered
            for patching and false otherwise. Presumed to be true if this
            function is not defined.
        def patchfile_applicable(config, filepath)
            Should return true if this patch file should be considered
            for patching and false otherwise. Presumed to be true if this
            function is not defined.
        def remove(config)
            Should return a list of file or directory paths to remove from
            the source tree. All paths should be relative to the base of the
            source tree. Presumed to return the empty list if this function
            is not defined.
        def add(config)
            Should return a list of 2- or 3-tuples of the form
                (<src-filename>, <dest-filepath>[, "force"])
            where <src-filename> is the name of a file in that directory
            and <dest-filepath> is a destination file path (relative to
            the base of the source tree). Specifying "force" will allow
            the added file to clobber an existing file. Note that the
            use of "force" currently means that unpatching does not
            properly revert to the starting state. Presumed to return
            the empty list if this function is not defined.
            If any file being added is named like BASE.p.EXT, it will be
            preprocessed.
        def patch_args(config):
            Return None or a list of command line args to add to patch.exe
            invocations. E.g. to set the fuzz level to 3 one would return
            ['-F3']. Note that spaces in args are quoted so separate args as
            separate list elements. In the previous example, ['-F 3'] is wrong
            but ['-F3'] or ['-F', '3'] or ['--fuzz', '3'] are okay.
            XXX Should use this patch arg info for unpatching.
        def patch_order(config):
            Return a list of patch file names in the order they should be
            applied.  Each patch file will go through the normal
            patchfile_applicable() checks; this is used only for ordering.  If
            this function is not defined, but a file named "series" does, that
            is used instead, with each file name on its own line.  If that does
            not exist either, all patch files (*.patch, *.diff, *.ppatch) in the
            directory are used in an undefined order.
    
    where "config" is a configuration object specified via patch()'s "config"
    argument or the --config command-line option. If no config is specified
    then this is None.
    
    If a directory is being considered then all *.patch and *.diff files are
    considered to be patches and all *.ppatch files are considered to be
    patches that must first be preprocessed (see preprocess.py,
    http://starship.python.net/crew/tmick/#preprocess). The given "config"
    is used to create a set of preprocessor defines in the following way:
        
        type(config)        Conversion to preprocess defines
        ------------------  -----------------------------------------------
        <type 'module'>     Convert all globals to PT_CONFIG_<varname>
                            defines. For example, this module:
                                name = "kermit"
                                animal = "frog"
                            will have PT_CONFIG_name and PT_CONFIG_animal
                            defines. Globals that start with an underscore
                            are excluded.
        <type 'dict'>       Convert all string/unicode keys to
                            PT_CONFIG_<varname> defines. Keys that start
                            with an underscore are excluded.
        otherwise           punt, no preprocessor defines

    If a "series" file exists within a patch directory, it is used for patch
    ordering.
