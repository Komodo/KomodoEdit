# Blackfile for project "custombuild"
#
#
# Currently Black has no ability to build a project. However,
# it can invoke a custom build procedure as expressed in the
# commandOverrides['build'] variable in a project Blackfile.py.
#
# This test project demonstrates how to do this.
#
# try running the following commands:
#   > bk
#   > bk configure
#   > bk                  # notice the change
#   > bk build
#   > bk build 42
#   > bk -v build 42
#

import black, black.configure.std


# Define the configuration items for this project.
configuration = {
    # It is good practice to define a name and version for a project.
    "version": "0.1",

def SayHello(projectConfig, argv):

    # a custom build procedure is passed the command line arg vector
    print("the command line args are", argv[1:])
    # the project configuration module (i.e. bkconfig.py) is passed in so the
    # routine can determine configuration items:
    #  - invoke perl using the configured Perl bin directory
    if len(argv[1:]) > 0:
        try:
            exitValue = int(argv[1])
