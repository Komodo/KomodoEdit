# Some additions (or improvements) to Python's std "shutil" module:
# 
#    Which      - like the Unix "which" command
#    WhichFollowSymLinks
#    Mkdir      - like "mkdir -p" plus a little
#    Copy       - more like "cp"
#    RmTree     - like "rm -rf <dirname>"
#    
#    RunCommands - run a given set of commands s.t. stdio redirection works
#    RunInContext - run a given set of commands in a given environment
