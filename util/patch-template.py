 USAGE: python patch-template.py <templatefile> <outputfile>
           [[<key> <replacement-string>|@<replacement-file>]... ]

 Patch the given template file (<templatefile>) with the given dictionary
 (string of key, value pairs on the command line). If the replacement value
 begins with '@' and identifies a file then the contents of the file (instead
 of the string itself) are used as the replacement value. The output is written
 to <outputfile>.

 Examples:
   python patch-template.py install.sh.template install.sh
       __DEFAULT_INSTALLDIR__ /usr/local/Komodo-1.0
   python patch-template.py LICENSE.html.template LICENSE.html
