- [major bug] Add mk/bin to PATH on Windows (i.e. using 'mk.exe') causes
  Python path issues that breaks, e.g. "mk quicksetup" on TaraG's box
  in "code.as.com" project.
- svn prop issues causing test failures. Get all props from old repo.
- failure to have a config.py should be lazy. Only try to load it, and
  error out, when first access to self.cfg\.  This allows tasks that
  don't need the config to run or to adapt if there is no config (e.g. "mk
  distclean"). The error could also pinpoint the location of the cfg
  usage
- a plan for this (see kodoc/Makefile.py for practical example of prob):
    #TODO: This sucks because of lack of cfg access.
    
    print dir(cfg)
    print "TASK", build.deps
    print "CFG", cfg.build_dir

    mn.read(join("en-US", "manifest.ini"))
    for dst, src in mn.items("all"):

- alternative TaskGroup idea:
    class foo(TaskGroup):
        def tasks(self):
            yield PreprocessTask(dep, result)
            yield CopyTask(src, dst)
            ...
  Can this work?
- File:
    - document its intended uses: Should it be able to have a "def make"?
      E.g. what about foo.p.py -> foo.py preprocessing for Komodo? How would
      that be handled?
    - should File move to file.py or something? Move to makefile.py for starters
- rationalize 'log' args to mklib.sh.* functions
- see "TODO: mk" in kodoc/Makefile.py
- look at "DoIt":https://launchpad.net/doit 
- Rules. An idea:
    class doc_file(Rule):
        """A doc file under $lang/... is built to $build_dir/$lang/...
        by this rule.
        """
        def match(self, src):
            """Returns the result path that this rule generates for the
            given path, or None if this rule does not apply to the given
            input path.

            return join(self.cfg.build_dir, src)

        def make(self, src, dst):

- test suite work:
    - does 'Configuration' "take" if defined after a Task?
      From Makefile.define_task, it looks like no.
    - see TODOs for test cases in the code
    - case for recursive dependencies
    - more comparison output with make (e.g., make foo foo)
    - one for each rake test?
- improve "-T|--tasks" description in "-h" output
- need a way to depend on a Configuration change (or on a manually handled
  version of config stuff) -> perhaps on the hashed value of the given
  data. Could try to make that automatic/easy with usage of 'self.cfg'?
  Maybe that would be too subtle/implicit.
- Experiment with Komodo build scenarios (e.g. PreprocessTask, better yet
  a PreprocessRule) to get a feel for limitations.
- directory switching when executing tasks
    - logging the directory switches
- path normalization necessary?
- equivalent to rakelib support? How does that work? (Was looking at packr
  example -- see Reader star on Ajaxian)
- all targets implicitly depend on the Doitfile
  (there should also probably be a mechanism to include other support files
  in that)
- Special error handling for no arg and no default task. Should we
  follow rake and have an actual separate "default" task? Might fit better
  with "default" tasks in imported makefile.
- something more compelling than test/data/simplecproj/Makefile.py. That is
  quite long and will need to be defended.
- equiv for rake's "directory" task (would it be helpful)?
- singular '<task>.result' and '<task>.dep' support
- md5-based out-of-date handling
- a library of useful common functions (c.f. rake/lib/rake/contrib/sys.rb)
- guard against recursive task deps
- improve "no default task" error msg to refer to "mk -T[v]" for list of
  tasks
- play with a nice way to easily get C/C++ header deps
- give example of specializing a Configuration class
- error/warning highlighting in bash:
    c.f. http://shawnwilsher.com/archives/184
    make()
    {
      pathpat="(/[^/]*)+:[0-9]+”
      ccred=$(echo -e “\033[0;31m")
      ccyellow=$(echo -e "\033[0;33m")
      ccend=$(echo -e "\033[0m")
      /usr/bin/make "$@" 2>&1 | sed -E -e "/[Ee]rror[: ]/ s%$pathpat%$ccred&$ccend%g" -e "/[Ww]arning[: ]/ s%$pathpat%$ccyellow&$ccend%g"
      return ${PIPESTATUS[0]}
    }




Design notes
============

- tasks should be collected by TaskMaster (because there can be
  multiple Doitfile's)
- each task given a link back to its Doitfile


Side thoughts
=============

- use FSEvents on Leopard to speed up determination of what's changed
