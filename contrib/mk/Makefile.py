    """_paths_from_path_patterns([<path-patterns>, ...]) -> file paths

    Generate a list of paths (files and/or dirs) represented by the given path
    patterns.

        "path_patterns" is a list of paths optionally using the '*', '?' and
            '[seq]' glob patterns.
        "files" is boolean (default True) indicating if file paths
            should be yielded
        "dirs" is string indicating under what conditions dirs are
            yielded. It must be one of:
              never             (default) never yield dirs
              always            yield all dirs matching given patterns
              if-not-recursive  only yield dirs for invocations when
                                recursive=False
            See use cases below for more details.
        "recursive" is boolean (default True) indicating if paths should
            be recursively yielded under given dirs.
        "includes" is a list of file patterns to include in recursive
            searches.
        "excludes" is a list of file and dir patterns to exclude.
            (Note: This is slightly different than GNU grep's --exclude
            option which only excludes *files*.  I.e. you cannot exclude
            a ".svn" dir.)
        "on_error" is an error callback called when a given path pattern
            matches nothing:
                on_error(PATH_PATTERN)
            If not specified, the default is look for a "log" global and
            call:
                log.error("`%s': No such file or directory")
            Specify None to do nothing.

    Typically this is useful for a command-line tool that takes a list
    of paths as arguments. (For Unix-heads: the shell on Windows does
    NOT expand glob chars, that is left to the app.)

    Use case #1: like `grep -r`
      {files=True, dirs='never', recursive=(if '-r' in opts)}
        script FILE     # yield FILE, else call on_error(FILE)
        script DIR      # yield nothing
        script PATH*    # yield all files matching PATH*; if none,
                        # call on_error(PATH*) callback
        script -r DIR   # yield files (not dirs) recursively under DIR
        script -r PATH* # yield files matching PATH* and files recursively
                        # under dirs matching PATH*; if none, call
                        # on_error(PATH*) callback

    Use case #2: like `file -r` (if it had a recursive option)
      {files=True, dirs='if-not-recursive', recursive=(if '-r' in opts)}
        script FILE     # yield FILE, else call on_error(FILE)
        script DIR      # yield DIR, else call on_error(DIR)
        script PATH*    # yield all files and dirs matching PATH*; if none,
                        # call on_error(PATH*) callback
        script -r DIR   # yield files (not dirs) recursively under DIR
        script -r PATH* # yield files matching PATH* and files recursively
                        # under dirs matching PATH*; if none, call
                        # on_error(PATH*) callback

    Use case #3: kind of like `find .`
      {files=True, dirs='always', recursive=(if '-r' in opts)}
        script FILE     # yield FILE, else call on_error(FILE)
        script DIR      # yield DIR, else call on_error(DIR)
        script PATH*    # yield all files and dirs matching PATH*; if none,
                        # call on_error(PATH*) callback
        script -r DIR   # yield files and dirs recursively under DIR
                        # (including DIR)
        script -r PATH* # yield files and dirs matching PATH* and recursively
                        # under dirs; if none, call on_error(PATH*)
                        # callback
