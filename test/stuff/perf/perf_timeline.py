"""Komodo performance metrics gather via the timeline mechanism.

Here is how the timeline "perfs" work:
1. Komodo is started with the appropriate environment to activate the
   timeline logging.
2. A macro is run in that Komodo to do whatever tasks are being timed,
   like, say openning a file and closing it 100 times.
3. Komodo is closed.
4. The timeline log is processed by each of the perf_*() methods to
   extra the specific bit of information desired.

Each perf_*() method is structured like this:
    def perf_*(self):
        "description of this perf"
        timeline = _getTimeline()
        # extract datum from timeline...
        return result   # or: return {"result": result, "log": log}
"""
