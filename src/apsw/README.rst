APSW stands for Another Python SQLite Wrapper.

About
=====

APSW is a Python wrapper for the `SQLite <http://sqlite.org/>`__
embedded relational database engine. In contrast to other wrappers
such as `pysqlite <https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite>`__ it focuses
on being a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate the
complete SQLite API into Python.  The `documentation
<http://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/pysqlite.html>`__ has a section on
the differences between APSW and pysqlite.  APSW supports CPython 2.3
onwards and CPython 3.1 onwards.
