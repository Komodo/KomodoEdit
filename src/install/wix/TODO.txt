- test on Win9x
- Ensure that all files (and dirs) get removed on uninstall. Check for
  non-admin install as well: it might work differently.
- drop the customaction build stuff: not used anymore


# Someday Maybe

- am I breaking "msiexec.exe /a" Admin install functionality that worked
  before?
- detect if another Komodo is installed and, if not raise INSTALLLEVEL such
  that "register as default" is done
- XXX's in the .wxs file(s)
- update install notes (if relevant)
- File associations work: redesign how it works with the installer and
  registry and Komodo runtime. Strawman:
      - single registry entry for each file association type
      - registry search to set one property for each
      - MSI dialog for setting these
      - conditional <ProgId> for each
  Problems with Strawman: one registry/prop for each limits to a hardcoded
  set: doesn't allow adding adhoc associations from the "Windows Integration"
  prefs panel. 
  Perhaps the added reliability and simplicity of this would make up for the
  difference of not being able to easily add adhoc associations.
- go through Komodo InstallShield project looking for missed bits
- validate against ICEs (some I don't consider relevant: mostly errors
  regarding HKCU and installing things to the user-specific profile area)
- change the Modify, repair, or remove installation dialog to the nicer one
  that the WiX Tutorial described
- Checkbox-based UI for the Desktop Integration stuff
- Should there be a SOFTWARE\ActiveState\Komodo\X.Y\Path = [INSTALLDIR] or
  something like that so subsequent install-y bits can find Komodo?
- large font vs. small font banner thing in installer UI
- Can message for "another ver of prod. already installed" be improved?
- Uninstall previous version automatically?
- make the working dir for the Komodo shortcuts to be the users "home"
  directory -- which itself is constructed by a custom action: either %HOME%
  if set, or "My Documents" (or perhaps the HOMEDRIVE\HOMEPATH combo?)
- a "wix" tool: A tool that encapsulates all the WiX tools. Also adds
  "addguids", "wax" and "orca" (find and open Orca).


# TODO for ActivePython

- In addition to all the Komodo MSI features, ActivePython also has the
  warning dialog about limitations of a per-user vs. "AllUsers" installation.


# For the "Komodo MSI features" spec

This list is here to add to a potential future "MSI features" spec. There are
some bits from previous versions of this file that should get included.

- Start Menu program group with:
    - Komodo X.Y
    - Modify, Repair or Uninstall Komodo
    - various documentation links
- Quick Launch shortcut (optional via "quicklaunch" feature selection)
- Desktop shortcut (optional via "desktop" feature selection)
- Add komodo.exe to PATH (optional via "register" feature selection, NOT done
  by default in pre-release builds).
- Registry "komodo.exe" "App Paths" registry key (in "register" feature)
- Regarding "install for all users" vs. "install only for me". Some
  installations present a choice to the user -- and obviously only the latter
  is available for unprivileged users. Currently the Komodo MSI just ties
  this decision to whether the user is privileged (i.e. if they *can* install
  for all users then that what will be done).
  Pros:
  - One less dialog in the installation process. (And one less decision that
    could potentially confuse the user. "What can go wrong if I select option
    FOO?)
  - Eliminates the possibility of a conflict of separate users both trying to
    "install only for me".
  - Easy for authoring the installer: just set ALLUSERS property to 2.
  Cons:
  - Some user *may* want this option. However, having been doing this for two
    years for ActivePython I've never had a request for that.
- Red flag: there *isn't* any "All Users" Quick Launch folder. Oh well.
  The Quick Launch icon is then always just for the installing user.
  *Could* offer to do so on first run, but that is overkill for now.
  TOTEST: That uninstalling as a different user than installed it does
  not choke trying to remove a Quick Launch icon that it cannot access.
- launch Komodo and User Guide checkboxes at end of install
- associate the .kpf and .ui file types with Komodo (with appropriate
  descriptions, verbs and icons)
