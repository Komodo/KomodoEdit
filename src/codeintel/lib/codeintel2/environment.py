"""Runtime environment handling for codeintel

"Environment" here means more than just the environment variables (i.e.
os.environ). It also means preferences/settings/conditions that are part
of the running environment for a codeintel Manager or Buffer.

Generally the relevant environment is used to get data such environment
variables and preferences (e.g., what Python interpreter is relevant,
what level of JS DOM APIs should be considered).

The Manager has an 'env' attribute (by default, an Environment instance)
and, optionally, a buffer can have a custom environment (also the 'env'
attribute). The latter is useful for sharing a project environment
across all buffers part of the same project.

For example, out-of-process Buffers used for Komodo have a
codeintel2.oop.driver.Environment instance.

Read the base Environment class for details on the API.
