# Basic structure of a CIX 2.0 file.

                ...classes, functions, variables, imports...
            </scope>

            <scope ilk="blob" lang="JavaScript" name="blah.rhtml" src=".../blah.rhtml">

            </scope>

# Notes on this schema

"line" and "lineend" attributes are 1-based. As well, they are only optional to
allow for CIX describing binary modules (where a line number does not make
sense). They are strongly recommended for text files.

CITDL stands for CodeIntel Type Determination Language. It is an expression
that is evaluated to figure out what type a variable is. Examples:

    list       # the list symbol (possibly Python's built-in list object)
    foo()      # the result of calling function foo
    foo.bar    # member 'bar' of symbol 'foo'

Why 'ilk' for scope type? Ilk is a synonym for "type", but "type" is
overloaded. It is short (good for space savings), it is weird (people won't
think this is related to type inferencing info) and it is rare (good for
finding uses in the codeintel sources).

"ilk" dev note: Developers should be aware that ilk is used by multiple
element types and that it is not enough to simply check the ilk type to
work out the type of element, you should be checking both the tag name
and then the ilk type to determine element type.

Why 'blob' for modules/packages/importable-things? See
<http://p4.activestate.com/p4db/changeView.cgi?CH=269772> for a reasons why.


# Common attributes

These are the shared common attributes that are used in any of the elements
below.

    __exported__, __exportable__
        To support Perl's special @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK Exporter
        variables, respectively. A Perl symbol tag should have
        the appropriate attribute if it is a member of one of
        these lists.
    __hidden__
        Indicates that this symbol is not externally accessible for
        the purposes of completion. This can be required for binary
        modules. For example Python's pyexpat module has a
        ParserCreate() factory function which returns a
        pyexpat.xmlparser class instance. However, the 'xmlparser'
        class is not otherwise accessible on the pyexpat module.
    __local__
        Indicates that this element is local to the current scope, i.e.
        not visible externally. This was initially added to support
        Perl's package variables declared with "my". This has started
        to extend to other languages such as JavaScript, which uses
        this attribute for variables declared with "var" and "const".
    __fabricated__
        Indicates that this element (and its contents) does not necessarily
        represent the actual code in the underlying document.  For example,
        Rails migration classes contain an "uninteresting" class, which
        often contain methods that define parts of an ActiveRecord::Base
        class.  Fabricated items are intended to be usable in code-completion
        lists, but need not show up in code browser windows.
    private, protected
        Indicates that this item is private or protected.
        Note: Current completion processing does not use these
        attributes. Komodo's code browser does, however, adding
        a small black lock icon to the element.
    deprecated
        Indicates that this item should not be used anymore.
    constant
        Indicates that this item can/should not be modified.
        Note: PHP is defining constants by setting the ilk="constant" attribute
        on the variable element instead. This is because PHP needs to
        distinguish between the two, as PHP constants trigger differently to PHP
        variables. Setting the ilk="constant" attribute will affect the results
        of database API calls that depend upon an "ilk" attribute, like
        "toplevel_cplns()".


# TODO

- Change "module" on <import> be to blob (to conform to the s/module/blob/
  changes elsewhere.

                 With Ruby's 'include'-statement you import a symbol (a Ruby
                 'module') from an unspecified blob (a.k.a. a module).

                 This should be left blank if just the module name is
                 "imported", as with "use Foo();" in Perl and "import foo"
                 in Python.

                 If a single code statement imports multiple symbols, then
                 multiple <import> CIX tags should be generated. E.g.:
                    use Alphagetti qw(a b);         # Perl
                    from Alphagetti import a, b     # Python
                 should result in something like:
                    <import module="Alphagetti" symbol="a"/>
                    <import module="Alphagetti" symbol="b"/>

                 There are two special symbol values:
                 - symbol="*"
                    Indicates that all normally exported symbols are
                    imported. E.g. "from foo import *" in Python, "use Foo;"
                    in Perl.
                 - symbol="**"
                    Indicates that all exportable symbols are imported. This
                    is essentially a hack for Perl to somewhat support
                    %EXPORT_TAGS usage. AutoComplete evaluation will treat
                    "**" as an import of all @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK symbols.

                    variables and static class variables. Some language, e.g.

                    objects on the fly.

                    Indicates that this is a constant (if the particular
                    language distinguishes that at all, e.g. Ruby).
