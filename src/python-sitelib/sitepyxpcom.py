"""Komodo's sitepyxpcom: loaded by the PyXPCOM Component Loader
(pyloader) during XPCOM initialization.

Redirect Python's stdout/stderr to log files in Komodo user app data
dir. This is necessary on Windows if running without a console
(subsystem:windows). Otherwise Python output during PyXPCOM registration
can choke, fail, result in borked PyXPCOM and result in faulty Komodo
startup.

As well, these log files might be useful for debugging.

Note: this is only done for non-verbose mode. I.e. if "-v" is used the
output is written to the console.
