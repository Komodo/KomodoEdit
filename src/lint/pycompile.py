"""Compile the given Python script and gather and print error/warning data.

Usage:
    python pycompile.py <filename>

Output on stdout is a prettily formatted list of Python dicts, one dict for
each syntax error and tabnanny warning. For example:
    [{'description': 'exceptions.SyntaxError: invalid syntax',
      'filename': 't.py',
      'lineno': 9,
      'offset': 6,   # may be None if not known (e.g. tabnanny warnings)
      'severity': 'ERROR',
      'text': 'foo =\n'}]

Output on stderr include warnings from the warnings framework:
    t.py:7: SyntaxWarning: import * only allowed at module level
      def foo():

Dev Notes:
- This script should work with Python >= 1.5.2, <= 3.0. We use the 2to3
  converter to make a version of this script for Python >=3.0.
