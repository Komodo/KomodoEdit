        those that have been fixed in this release, or to add comments or
        additional issues, please visit the <a class="doc" href=
        "http://bugs.ActiveState.com/Komodo">Komodo Bug Database</a>. Komodo
        Snapdragon inherits the following known issues from Komodo Edit.</p>

        <h3><a name="install_issues" id=
        "install_issues">Installation &amp; Upgrade</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>When upgrading to a version of Komodo with a new
          <a href="trouble.html#appdata_dir">application
          data directory</a> (i.e. 4.0.1 to 4.0.3 or 4.0.3 to 4.1),
          the usernames and passwords for <a href=
          "prefs.html#Servers">Remote Accounts</a> are
          not imported. These must be re-entered for each Server in
          the Server Preferences panel after the upgrade.</li>

          <li>Windows Vista will prompt you to either 'Allow' or
          'Deny' the installation. Click on 'Allow' and Komodo will
          install normally.</li>

          <li>The Komodo installer requires up to 230 MB in your
          TMP directory (as indicated by the value of your 'TMP'
          environment variable) during installation, even if you
          plan to install Komodo to another drive. If you do not
          have the required space on this drive, manually set the
          'TMP' environment variable to another directory with
          sufficient space. Ensure that you have enough space,
          temporarily, for installation. (Bug 7057)</li>

          <li>If you try to install Komodo on Windows and the MSI
          install fails with error 2355, your MSI file is corrupt.
          Please download Komodo again and re-run the MSI install.
          (Bug 7405)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3><a name="Startup_Issues" id=
        "Startup_Issues">Startup</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The first time Komodo is run after installation, it
          must register a number of components with the operating
          system. This causes the first launch to be considerably
          slower than subsequent launches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="Editing_Issues" id=
        "Editing_Issues">Editing</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Linux users may need to install the <acronym title="Smart Common
          Input Method">SCIM</acronym> platform packages for non-ASCII text
          entry. See "<a href="readme.html#System_Req_Lin">Linux Software
          Prerequisites</a>" in the Installation Guide for details. (Bug
          70812)</li>
          
          <li>The line and column cursor coordinates in the status
          bar are not updated while the cursor is moving.</li>

          <li>The macro recorder will record events that it cannot
          handle, such as the opening of dialogs. The only dialog
          that can be opened via a macro is the Find dialog; other
          dialogs will cause the macro to stop.</li>

          <li>Languages that are read right to left and Asian
          languages are not supported. All Latin and Cyrillic
          languages are fully supported. (Bug 29702)</li>

          <li>On slow networks, users may notice performance
          degradation when editing files on network machines.
          Performance can be improved by disabling the Komodo
          function that checks if files on disk have changed. Use
          the <a href="prefs.html#prefs_editor">Editor
          Preferences</a> to disable this feature. (Bug 18297)</li>

          <li>Interpolation shortcuts in snippets are not executed
          when the snippet is inserted in the Editor Pane via
          dragging and dropping.</li>

          <li>On Linux, GTK2 hard codes 'Ctrl'+'Shift' to use
          international input. Therefore, all key bindings
          involving 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+ (any valid hexadecimal
          character} do not work in Komodo. A workaround is to
          start Komodo with the command: <code>export
          GTK_IM_MODULE=xim; ./komodo'</code>. Otherwise, key
          bindings of this kind must be changed. (Bug 38205)</li>

          <li>When copying text that does not have Windows line
          endings into another application, which expects Windows
          line endings, the text may not retain the desired
          formatting. The text is often pasted as a single line.
          (Bug 36791)</li>

          <li>Code snippets that are 8-bit-encoded and contain
          high-bit characters may have the wrong encoding (or no
          encoding) when inserted from the Toolbox into a UTF-8
          encoded file in the Editor Pane. (Bug 36769)</li>

          <li>When editing a code comment in Komodo you may use
          &lt;Shift+Enter&gt; to start a new line <em>within</em>
          the comment -- the comment prefix is added automatically.
          Komodo may fail to properly add the comment prefix if
          many new lines are added quickly with repeated
          &lt;Shift+Enter&gt; presses. (Bug 38658)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="OSX_Issues" id="OSX_Issues">Mac OS X</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>If you have two drives with the same name, and you
          use the file open dialog in a mozilla application, the
          directory menu (top middle of dialog) may crash when
          clicked. To avoid this, rename one of the hard
          drives.</li>

          <li>New Custom Menus created in a Project or in the
          Toolbox will not appear until Komodo has been
          restared.</li>

          <li>Throughout the Komodo documentation there are
          references to key bindings that use the 'Meta' key. This
          key may be better known to OS X users as the 'Command'
          key. (Bug 41959)</li>

          <li>Komodo will shut down and restart itself the first
          time it is run after installation. (Bug 40143)</li>

          <li>Display of text during editing ("painting") may
          sometimes be slow or pause momentarily.</li>

          <li>Certain UI elements stop working after changing key
          bindings. Restarting Komodo fixes this. (Bug 38683)</li>

          <li>When saving a file, Komodo does not set file
          information (type and creator) for the OS X Finder to
          know that Komodo created the file. (Bug 38745)</li>

          <li>Komodo is sometimes recognized as a web browser by
          some applications on OS X (e.g. Safari's "Default Web
          Browser" setting). Using Komodo as the default web
          browser is not recommended.</li>

          <li>Application menu items that have multi-key key
          bindings will not show their key bindings in a pop-up
          tool tip on OS X. This is a limitation in OS X.</li>

          <li>Context menus may not display unless you hold down
          the mouse button for a period of time. This is because
          the Komodo editor is implemented in Mozilla as a plugin,
          and it does not access the apropriate context menu event
          to handle this behaviour properly without interfering
          with other mouse events (for example, drag and drop).
          (Bug 41216)</li>

          <li>Due to a limitation in the Mozilla code base, key
          bindings for the <strong>Next File</strong> and
          <strong>Previous File</strong> options on the
          <strong>Window</strong> menu are not displayed next to
          the menu items. The key bindings are 'Meta'+'PageDown' to
          view the next file and 'Meta'+'PageUp' to view the
          previous file. (Bug 40716)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="Linux_Issues" id="Linux_Issues">Linux</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>When closing any Komodo window that contains an
          editor component, a GLIB error entry will appear in the
          log files (or terminal if Komodo was started from one).
          This error can be safely ignored. A patch was submitted
          by the Mozilla group to the Gnome group that handles this
          error, and should be available in GTK 2.4 or higher. The
          patch can be viewed at
          http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128546<br />
          (Bug 33817)</li>

          <li>The <strong>Fonts and Colors</strong> pane in the
          Preferences dialog box displays the same list of fonts in
          both the Fixed and Proportional lists. There is no
          programmatic way to identify whether a font is
          proportional or not on GTK; therefore, users must know
          the properties of the individual fonts when modifying
          these values. (Bug 27206)</li>

          <li>If the GTK theme is changed while Komodo is running,
          Komodo will not change the menu/toolbar font colors,
          causing usability problems in extreme cases. (Bug
          34508)</li>

          <li>Install Komodo into a directory path that only
          includes alphanumeric characters. Komodo is known to have
          trouble with paths that include spaces and some
          non-alphanumeric characters.</li>

          <li>Filenames or paths containing non-ASCII characters
          cannot be opened remotely.</li>

          <li>Key bindings defined in the window manager (such as
          KDE) take precedence over Komodo key bindings. In the
          case of conflicts, you must either change the Komodo key
          bindings or the window manager key bindings. (Bug
          30926)</li>

          <li>You cannot move an existing Komodo installation to a
          new directory. You must uninstall Komodo from the
          existing location and reinstall it in the new location.
          (Bug 19478)</li>

          <li>Red Hat Linux 9.0 is known to have threading library
          bugs in its glibc that may cause Komodo to hang in
          certain situations. The recommended solution is to
          upgrade to the latest glibc for Red Hat Linux 9.0. (Bug
          24340)</li>

          <li>Komodo may not start up correctly on some Linux
          systems if C++ compatibility libraries have not been
          installed. On Fedora and Red Hat systems, install the
          "compat-libstdc++" package. On SuSE, install the "compat"
          package. On Gentoo, as root, run <code>emerge
          lib-compat</code>. This is not thought to be a problem on
          Debian systems. (Bug 36244)</li>

          <li>Komodo will work on Debian/Ubuntu AMD64 with some
          manual configuration (some libraries were not properly
          ported to support 32-bit applications). (Bug 41368) Run
          Komodo from a shell script which sets certain environment
          variables:
            <pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
export GTK_PATH=/usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/
export PANGO_RC_FILE=/etc/pango32/pangorc
komodo
</pre>The <code>pangorc</code> file should contain the following:
            <pre class="code">
[Pango]
ModuleFiles=/etc/pango32/pango.modules
[PangoX]
AliasFiles=/etc/pango/pangox.aliases
</pre>More information on running 32 bit Mozilla applications on
AMD64 can be found <a href=
"http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=84732">here</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="Other_Issues" id="Other_Issues">Other</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>A limitation in the parser used by the DOM Viewer
          causes HTML elements embedded in JavaScript strings to
          appear as element nodes of the current document. Placing
          the JavaScript in a CDATA section or a comment avoids
          this problem.</li>

          <li>Komodo inherits a Mozilla bug whereby certain video
          drivers on Windows cause Komodo to crash. If you
          experience this behavior, upgrade your video driver to
          the latest version. If the problem persists, reduce the
          color definition assigned to the driver (<strong>Control
          Panel|Display|Settings</strong>). (Bug 32746)</li>

          <li>Komodo inherits a <a href=
          "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230512">Mozilla
          bug</a> regarding display on dual-monitor systems where
          the secondary monitor is to the left of the primary
          monitor (causing negative coordinate results). The Komodo
          display occasionally fails to refresh; Komodo must be
          stopped and restarted to fix the display (Bug 26852)</li>

          <li>When using Komodo's Preview in Browser feature, users
          running Mozilla on Windows XP Pro, Windows 2000 Pro and
          Windows 98 may find that they cannot exit Komodo if
          Mozilla is still open. If this should occur, close all
          open browser windows before exiting Komodo. (Bug
          26431)</li>

          <li>The Palm Desktop for Windows software makes exclusive
          use of the 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'T' key combination, thus
          making this combination unavailable in Komodo. (Bug
          27851)</li>

          <li>On Windows NT, some interactive commands may not work
          properly when run from the <strong>Command
          Output</strong> tab of the Output Pane. You must run
          these commands in a separate shell. (Bug 23176)</li>

          <li>In file picker dialogs that display a list of files,
          when "All files" is specified, files that begin with a
          period are not displayed (Bug 18712)</li>

          <li>The Output tab cuts off lines at 250 characters. (Bug
          20711)</li>

          <li>Macros will not record certain commands, including
          (but possibly not limited to)
          'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'B'|'R'|'E'|'D' (toggle toolbars or button
          text), 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'N' (new default file), and View as
          Language menu items.</li>

          <li>Users of the Japanese version of Windows XP may
          experience difficulties in starting Komodo.</li>

          <li>The <strong>Open</strong> field in the Open/Find
          Toolbar does not automatically display a drop-down list
          of directories when an UNC path is typed. Currently, the
          list is only displayed when a the path includes a
          subdirectory. (Bug 29011)</li>

          <li>When adding new key bindings via the Preferences
          dialog box, Komodo displays a message indicating that the
          key bindings will not take effect until Komodo is
          restarted. However, some changes do take effect
          immediately.(Bug 36710)</li>

          <li>"Find" macros do not work because incorrect code is
          recorded. (Bug 36332)</li>

          <li>If you rename a folder that was added to a custom
          menu, the name is changed in Komodo's Toolbox but not on
          the menu itself. A workaround is to move the renamed
          folder out and then back into the associated custom menu
          icon in the Toolbox. (Bug 36679)</li>

          <li>The Mozilla code base currently does not support the
          Windows Unicode binary. As a result, Komodo for Windows
          is unable to open files or paths that contain character
          sets that are not in the systems locale. (Bug 33304)</li>

          <li>A newly created custom menu is added to the Toolbox
          but is not immediately displayed alongside existing
          toolbars. Restarting Komodo causes the new toolbar to
          display. (Bug 40078)</li>
