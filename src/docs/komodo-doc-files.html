  <h1><a name="files_top" id="files_top">Working with
  Files</a></h1>

  <p>Komodo provides a variety of methods for accessing and editing
  files. While files can be opened and edited individually, they
  can also be stored in <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">projects</a> or the
  <a href="komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> as
  components.</p>

  <p>If Komodo is configured to integrate with a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> system
  (SCC), status icons beside the filenames indicate the file's
  current SCC status, and SCC options are available from the
  <strong>File</strong> menu and the right-click context menus.
  This integration is described in detail in the Source Code
  Control section of the Komodo documentation.</p>

  <p>Files are manipulated in various ways: via the
  <strong>File</strong> menu, via context menus in the editor, via
  context menus on the file tab (above the editor), and as
  components within projects and the Toolbox.</p>

  <p>This document describes file functionality, such as opening,
  printing, and saving files. See the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-editor.html#editor_top">Editing</a> page for
  information about editing files.</p>

  <h2><a name="Creating_a_New_File" id=
  "Creating_a_New_File">Creating Files</a></h2>

  <p>To create a new file, click the "New File" button on the
  standard toolbar. (To display the standard toolbar, click
  <strong>View|Toolbars|Standard</strong>.) A new file with the
  default file extension for the file type is created and opened in
  the Komodo editor. Use the <a class="doc" href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#new_files">New Files</a> page in Komodo's
  Preferences to specify the default file extension for new
  files.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_templates" id="files_templates">Creating Files
  from Templates</a></h3>

  <p>New files can be created based on pre-defined templates that
  contain default content for specific file types. See the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-templates.html#templates_top">Templates</a>
  documentation for information about configuring custom
  templates.</p>

  <p>To create a new file from a template, select
  <strong>File|New|File</strong>. The New File dialog box contains
  numerous pre-defined templates organized into categories. Select
  the desired category, then select the desired template within
  that category.</p>

  <p>Click <strong>Open</strong> to create a file with the contents
  of the template file. The file is loaded in the editor.</p>

  <p>The <strong>File|New|File</strong> menu displays a list of the
  most recently accessed templates. To alter the number of template
  files displayed, refer to the <a class="doc" href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#new_files">New Files</a> page in Komodo's
  Preferences.</p>

  <p>To add a template to the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> for quick
  access, select the desired template and click <strong>Add to
  Toolbox</strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="files_projtool" id="files_projtool">Storing Files
  within a Project or the Toolbox</a></h2>

  <p>Files can be stored in a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a>, in the
  <a href="komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, or
  within <a href="komodo-doc-folders.html#folders_top">folders</a>
  in a project or the Toolbox. Storing a file within a project or
  the Toolbox creates a reference to the actual file located on the
  disk; it does not affect the file itself. Therefore, the same
  file can be stored in multiple projects and folders, both in
  projects and within the Toolbox; changes to the original source
  file apply regardless of the source of the file reference;
  deleting a file from a project or the Toolbox does not delete the
  file from the filesystem.</p>

  <p>While most file options (such as source code control commands,
  viewing unsaved changes, and refreshing the file status) are
  accessible regardless or whether or not the file is contained in
  a project or the Toolbox, some commands are specific to the
  project/Toolbox environment. These commands are described
  below.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_openshort" id="files_openshort">Creating an
  Open Shortcut to the Current File Location</a></h3>

  <p><a href="komodo-doc-openshort.html#openshort_top">Open...
  shortcuts</a>, stored within a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, are references
  to filesystem directories. When an open shortcut is invoked, the
  standard Open File dialog box is displayed with the contents of
  the directory.</p>

  <p>Open shortcuts can be created using a specific file as the
  context. Right-click a file in a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> and select
  <strong>Make "Open..." Shortcut</strong>. This creates an open
  shortcut to the directory where the file is stored.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_exproj" id="files_exproj">Exporting Files as
  Projects</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>Export as Project File</strong> option is used to
  create a new project file containing the file from which the
  option was invoked. To access this option, the file must be
  stored in a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>. Right-click
  the desired file name and select <strong>Export as Project
  File</strong>. You are prompted to provide the name of the new
  project file and the directory where it will be stored.</p>

  <p>To open the new project file, select
  <strong>File|Open|Project</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_expack" id="files_expack">Exporting Files to a
  Package</a></h3>

  <p>Files can be archived and distributed among multiple Komodo
  users via "packages". Packages are compressed archive files that
  contain the file from which the <strong>Export Package</strong>
  option was invoked. Packages are stored in files with a ".kpz"
  extension, and can be opened by any archiving utility that
  supports <code>libz</code> (for example WinZip). The
  <strong>Export Package</strong> option differs from the
  <strong>Export as Project File</strong> option in that copies of
  filesystem-based components (such as files and dialog projects)
  are included in the archive. Conversely, <strong>Export as
  Project File</strong> creates a project with a reference to the
  component's original location and does not create copies of the
  components. When <strong>Export Package</strong> is invoked, you
  are prompted for a name and file location for the package.</p>

  <p>Exported packages can only be imported into "container"
  objects in Komodo, such as projects, the Toolbox, and folders
  within projects and the Toolbox. See <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#export_import">Toolbox - Exporting and
  Importing Toolbox Contents</a>, <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_impexp">Projects - Importing and
  Exporting Projects via Packages</a>, or <a href=
  "komodo-doc-folders.html#folders_importpack">Folders - Import
  Contents from Package</a> for more information.</p>

  <h2><a name="Opening_a_File" id="Opening_a_File">Opening
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>There are numerous methods for opening files in Komodo. These
  include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Command-Line Argument</strong>: When Komodo is
    invoked from the command line, files can be specified as open
    arguments. See <a href=
    "komodo-doc-top.html#Windows_Start">Starting on Windows</a>,
    <a href="komodo-doc-top.html#OSX_Start">Starting on OSX</a>, or
    <a href="komodo-doc-top.html#Linux_Start">Starting on Linux</a>
    for more information.</li>

    <li><strong>File|Open</strong>: Use the <strong><a href=
    "#Opening_a_File">File|Open</a></strong> menu option.</li>

    <li><strong>Projects tab or Toolbox</strong>: Double-click,
    drag and drop, or use the file's right-click context menu to
    open a file contained in a <a href=
    "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a> or the
    <a href="komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Open/Find Toolbar</strong>: Use the <a href=
    "komodo-doc-search.html#editor_find_toolbar">Open/Find
    Toolbar</a>. To display the Open/Find Toolbar, select
    <strong>View|Toolbars|Open/Find</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Most Recently Used List</strong>: The most recently
    opened files are displayed on Komodo's Start Page. This list is
    also accessible from the <strong>File|Recent Files</strong>
    menu. The number of files in the most recently used list is
    determined by the <a href=
    "komodo-doc-prefs.html#UI_Configuration">Appearance</a>
    preference.</li>

    <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Drag and drop one or more
    files from another drag-and-drop application (such as Windows
    Explorer) onto the Komodo editor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="files_openfindtoolbar" id=
  "files_openfindtoolbar">Opening Files with the Open/Find
  Toolbar</a></h3>

  <p>The <a href=
  "komodo-doc-search.html#editor_find_toolbar">Open/Find
  Toolbar</a> provides quick access for opening files and finding
  strings. The toolbar is displayed in Komodo by default. To hide
  or show the toolbar, select
  <strong>View|Toolbars|Open/Find</strong>.</p>

  <p>Use the <strong>Open</strong> field on the <strong>Open/Find
  Toolbar</strong> to open one or more files in the filesystem. The
  <strong>Open</strong> field generates a drop-down list of files
  and directories as you navigate the hierarchy. To open a file,
  enter the file path and name, and then press 'Enter'.</p>

  <p>For example, to open a file named "debug.txt" in the directory
  <em>C:\temp\log</em> on a machine running Windows, enter
  <em>C:\tmp\log\debug.txt</em> in the <strong>Open</strong> field
  and then press 'Enter'. As you enter each backslash, a drop-down
  list displays the files and directories beneath the current
  directory.</p>

  <p>Enter "./" or ".\" in the <strong>Open</strong> field to
  display a list of files and directories in the "current"
  directory. The current directory is determined as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Current File</strong>: If a file is open in the
    editor, the directory where the file is stored is the current
    directory. If multiple files are open, the file that is
    currently displayed is the current file.</li>

    <li><strong>HOME Variable</strong>: If no files are open,
    Komodo checks if the system has a defined <code>HOME</code>
    environment variable. If so, the directory specified in that
    variable's value is the current directory.</li>

    <li><strong>Filesystem Root</strong>: If neither of the above
    conditions is met, the system's root directory is used ("C:\"
    is the default on Windows, and "/" is the default on Linux and
    Mac OS X).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To narrow the results in the list box, enter one or more
  characters in the name of the file or directory you wish to open
  or view. (The search is case-sensitive.) Alternatively, use the
  arrow keys to navigate the drop-down list. The contents of the
  <strong>Open</strong> field are updated as you move up and down
  the list with the arrow keys.</p>

  <p>Note that you can use standard directory navigation syntax to
  change directories. For example, if the current directory is
  <em>/home/fred/tmp/foo</em>, change to the
  <em>/home/fred/tmp/bar</em> directory by entering
  <em>../bar</em>.</p>

  <p>To open a file, press 'Enter' when the file name is displayed
  in the <strong>Open</strong> field. To continue navigating the
  directory structure, append a frontslash or backslash to the
  directory name displayed in the <strong>Open</strong> field; the
  drop-down list is updated with the list of files and directories
  that exist under the current location.</p>

  <p>To open multiple files, specify a wildcard ("*" for a file
  name segment, "?" for a specific character). For example, to open
  all the files with the extension ".tcl" in the directory
  <em>/home/fred/tmp</em>, enter <em>/home/fred/tmp/*.tcl</em>.</p>

  <p>At any time, press the 'Escape' key to return focus to the
  Komodo editor.</p>

  <h3><a name="Opening_Remote_Files" id=
  "Opening_Remote_Files">Opening Remote Files</a></h3>

  <p>Komodo can open files located on remote machines, providing
  that the remote machine is configured for FTP, SFTP, or SCP
  access. To quickly access frequently used servers, create an
  entry in the <a class="doc" href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Servers">Server Preferences</a>
  (<strong>Edit|Preferences|Servers</strong>).</p>

  <p>To open a file located on a remote server, select
  <strong>File|Open|Remote File</strong>.</p>

  <h4><a name="files_ftpconnect" id="files_ftpconnect">Connecting
  to a remote Server</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-Configured Server Connection</strong>: If
    remote servers have been configured in Komodo's <a class="doc"
    href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#Servers">Preferences</a>, select
    the name of the configuration from the <strong>Server</strong>
    drop-down list. Access the Server Configuration dialog box by
    clicking the <strong>Accounts</strong> button to the right of
    the <strong>Server</strong> field.</li>

    <li><strong>Manual Server Connection</strong>: Enter the
    server's fully qualified hostname in the
    <strong>Server</strong> field. Press 'Enter'. You are prompted
    to enter a name and password for the server. If the server is
    configured for anonymous access, select <strong>Anonymous
    login</strong>. To store the login name and password for the
    server, click <strong>Remember these values</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a name="files_navremote" id="files_navremote">Navigating the
  Remote File System</a></h4>

  <p>After establishing a connection to the remote server, a list
  of files and directories is displayed. These files and
  directories exist under the directory specified in the
  <strong>Look in</strong> field. Double-click a directory
  (indicated by a file folder icon) to navigate the directory
  structure. Use the navigation buttons in the top right corner of
  the dialog box to navigate the remote filesystem.</p>

  <p>To open a single file, double-click the filename. To open
  multiple files, hold down the 'Ctrl' key while clicking multiple
  files, then click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>

  <p>The buttons in the top right corner of the dialog box perform
  various file and directory manipulation functions. Hover your
  mouse pointer over the buttons for a description of their
  functions. To delete or rename a file on the remote server,
  right-click the filename and, with the left mouse button, select
  the desired command on the context menu.</p>

  <h4><a name="files_remprojtool" id="files_remprojtool">Storing
  Remote Files in Projects or the Toolbox</a></h4>

  <p>When remote files are added to a project or the Toolbox, or to
  container components within a project or the Toolbox, they are
  accessed and organized in the same manner as local files
  (double-clicking a file opens it in the editor; right-clicking a
  file accesses file option, etc). Remote files can only be added
  to projects or the Toolbox by connecting to the remote
  server.</p>

  <p>Login authentication is processed when the remote file is
  opened, or when it is added to the Toolbox or a project. For the
  duration of the Komodo session, the user name and password are
  remembered; closing and opening the file uses the same
  authentication information as the first time the file was opened.
  If authentication fails, you are prompted to enter a user name
  and password.</p>

  <p>After closing and re-opening Komodo, the authentication
  information stored in the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Servers">Servers</a> preference is checked
  again. Thus, changes to the user name or password stored in the
  server configuration do not take effect until Komodo is closed
  and re-opened. If no authentication information is stored in the
  server configuration, you are prompted to supply it when you open
  the file.</p>

  <p>See <a href="komodo-doc-project.html#project_add_comp">Adding
  Components to Projects</a> or <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_addcomp">Adding Components to
  the Toolbox</a> for instructions on adding remote files to the
  Toolbox or to projects.</p>

  <p>To open a remote file, double-click the file name, use the
  assigned key binding, or right-click the file and select
  <strong>Open File</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a name="Open_Mapped_URI" id="Open_Mapped_URI">Opening Mapped
  URIs</a></h3>

  <p><a href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#mapped_uris">Mapped URIs</a>
  can be opened by dragging a mapped link from a browser into
  Komodo. For example, if you mapped the URL
  <em>http://www.example.org/</em> to the local directory
  <em>/var/www/</em>, you could drag a link like
  <em>http://www.example.org/projects/test.html</em> from a browser
  into Komodo, which would open the local file
  <em>/var/www/projects/test.html</em></p>

  <p>This feature also works with URIs mapped to remote filesystems
  (via FTP, SFTP or SCP), which in turn can be configured for
  automatic authentication under <strong><a href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Servers">Edit|Preferences|Servers</a></strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Switching_Between_Files" id=
  "Switching_Between_Files">Switching Between Files</a></h2>

  <p>To switch between open files in the editor:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: Use the associated <a href=
    "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
    binding</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Editor Tabs</strong>: Click the tab with the
    desired filename.</li>

    <li><strong>Window Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Window</strong> menu, select <strong>Next File</strong>
    or <strong>Previous File</strong> to move from left to right
    (or right to left) across the file tabs. Alternatively, select
    the desired file from the list of files currently open in the
    editor.</li>

    <li><strong>Project or Toolbox</strong>: Double-click the
    filename.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If more files are opened than can be displayed by file tabs,
  click the right and left arrow buttons located in the top right
  corner of the editor to view the tabs of all open files.</p>

  <p>To re-order the position of the file tabs, drag and drop the
  tabs into the desired positions.</p>

  <p>For more information about working with the editor tabs, see
  <a href="komodo-doc-editor.html#editor_tabs">Editor Tab
  Display</a> in the editor documentation.</p>

  <h2><a name="Comparing_Files" id="Comparing_Files">Comparing
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo includes a "diff" mechanism used to compare files. To
  compare two files using Komodo's "diff" window:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Tools|Compare Files</strong>.</li>

    <li>By default, the path and file name of the file currently
    displayed in the editor is the first file for comparison. As
    desired, alter this selection by entering an alternate path and
    file, or browse for the desired file using
    <strong>Browse</strong> button. Use the same mechanism to
    specify the second file.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Compare Files</strong>. The contents of both
    files are displayed in the "diff" window.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If the file is stored in a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, this function
  can also be invoked by right-clicking the file and selecting
  <strong>Compare File With</strong>.</p>

  <p>The unique characteristics of each file are displayed in
  different colors (red and blue by default); common
  characteristics are displayed in a third color (black by
  default). To configure custom colors for the "diff" window, alter
  the <strong>Language-Specific Coloring</strong> setting for the
  <strong>Other|Diff</strong> language in the <a class="doc" href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#lang_specific">Fonts and Colors</a>
  preference.</p>

  <p>The following key bindings are available in the "diff"
  window:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>F8</strong>: Jump to the next change.</li>

    <li><strong>F7</strong>: Jump to the previous change.</li>

    <li><strong>F9</strong>: Jump to corresponding line. Opens
    and/or shifts focus to the original file in the Editor Pane. If
    viewing a diff in an editor tab, right-click and select
    <strong>Jump to Corresponding Line</strong> (or select
    <strong>Code|Jump to Corresponding Line</strong>) to shift
    focus to the editor tab containing the source code. Selecting
    this option opens the source code tab in the Editor Pane if it
    is not already open and/or shifts focus to the original file in
    the Editor Pane. (If viewing a diff in an editor tab,
    right-click and select <strong>Jump to Corresponding
    Line</strong>.)</li>

    <li><strong>Esc</strong>: close the window</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="files_refstatus" id="files_refstatus">Refreshing
  File Status</a></h2>

  <p>The <strong>Refresh Status</strong> option checks the
  read/write disk status for the component. If the file is of a
  language for which "code intelligence" is supported and enabled
  (as configured in the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#code_intel">Code Intelligence
  Preferences</a>), <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also updates
  the code intelligence database with the contents of the file.</p>

  <p>If the component is stored in a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> system,
  <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also checks the repository status
  of the file. Komodo determines whether a file is contained in an
  SCC repository by the following methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perforce</strong>: analysis of the client
    configuration</li>

    <li><strong>CVS</strong>: analysis of the CVS control
    directories</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To refresh the file status of the current file, right-click
  the file tab or right-click within the editor and select
  <strong>Refresh Status</strong>. The same option is available on
  the right-click context menu of files in <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">projects</a> or within the
  <a href="komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="files_scc" id="files_scc">Source Code
  Control</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo provides source code control support for files stored
  in CVS or Perforce repositories. Source code control support
  (including SCC configuration, status icons and specific commands)
  is described in detail in the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-scc.html#scc_top">Source Code Control</a> section of
  the documentation. To access source code control commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Editor Context Menu</strong>: Right-click a file in
    the editor and select <strong>Source Control</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>File Tab Context Menu</strong>: Right-click a file
    tab above the editor and select <strong>Source
    Control</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Toolbox or Project Context Menu</strong>:
    Right-click a file in the <a class="doc" href=
    "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> or <a href=
    "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">Projects tab</a> and
    select <strong>Source Control</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Toolbox or Project Menu</strong>: If a file is
    currently selected in the <a href=
    "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> or <a href=
    "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">Projects tab</a>, use the
    menu to access source code control commands for the selected
    file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="files_settings" id="files_settings">File Properties
  and Settings</a></h2>

  <p>In addition to the Komodo's global <a href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#prefs_top">Preferences</a>, some
  preferences can also be configured on a per-file basis. These
  settings override the global and project level preferences. To
  access the Properties and Settings dialog box for a file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edit Menu</strong>: On the <strong>Edit</strong>
    menu, click <strong>Current File Settings</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Editor Context Menu</strong>: Right-click in the
    editor and select <strong>Properties and Settings</strong> from
    the context menu.</li>

    <li><strong>File Tab Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the tab
    above the editor that displays the filename, and select
    <strong>Properties and Settings</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="files_settings_props" id="files_settings_props">File
  Properties</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>Properties</strong> category in the Properties and
  Settings dialog box displays general information about the file,
  such as the directory where it is stored, the size and creation
  and modification dates. The following file characteristics can be
  modified on this tab:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Toggle the file's status
    between writable and read-only.</li>

    <li><strong>Language</strong>: This field displays the current
    language association (which affects language-specific options
    like syntax coloring and AutoComplete) for the current file. To
    change the language association, select another language from
    the drop-down list. To set the language association to the
    Komodo default (as configured in the <a href=
    "komodo-doc-prefs.html#File_Associations">File Association
    Preference</a>, click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Encoding</strong>: Use this field to set the
    <a href=
    "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Internationalization">International
    Encoding</a> for the current file. Select <strong>Use signature
    (BOM)</strong> to use the byte order mark (a Unicode character
    at the top of the file which indicates the encoding) if
    present.</li>

    <li><strong>Line Endings</strong>: Use this field to set the
    desired line endings for the current file. By default, Komodo
    preserves the line endings contained in a file when the file is
    opened. (Default line endings for new files are configured in
    the <a class="doc" href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#new_files">New

  </ul>For HTML and XML documents, two additional settings are
  available:

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Default DOCTYPE</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Default Namespace</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Komodo tries to determine these values from the document's XML
  declaration. If the document does not have one, the DOCTYPE and
  namespace can be manually set here, enabling appropriate XML
  autocompletion. XHTML 1.1 is the default if no delaration or
  settings are present.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_settings_scc" id="files_settings_scc">File
  Source Control Settings</a></h3>

  <p>If Komodo is configured to work in conjunction with a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-scc.html#scc_top">Source Code Control</a> system, the
  <strong>Source Code Control</strong> category displays the
  current SCC status and settings.</p>

  <h3><a name="browser_preview" id="browser_preview">Browser
  Preview</a></h3>

  <p>This option configures the behavior of the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-editor.html#browser_preview">Preview in Browser</a>
  function. When the Preview in Browser function is invoked, you
  are prompted to specify the file or URL used to preview the
  current file. (For example, when previewing a CSS file, specify
  an HTML file to use for the preview.) The Preview in Browser
  dialog box has an option for remembering the specification. If
  that option is enabled, the file or URL specified is displayed in
  the <strong>Preview</strong> field. Click <strong>Change</strong>
  to alter the preview file.</p>

  <h2><a name="Printing" id="Printing">Printing Files</a></h2>

  <p>To print the file that is currently displayed in the editor,

    the size of the margins in inches.</li>

    <li><strong>Headers and Footers</strong>: Use the drop-down
    lists to select the type of information that appears in the
    headers and/or footers, and to determine their position on the
    page. The top row of lists contains the header options, and the
    bottom row contains the footer options. Choose from options
    such as "Title", "URL" and "Page #". Select the "Custom" option
    from any of the drop-down lists to enter custom header
    information. To print without headers and footers, select the
    "blank" option in each of the drop-down lists.</li>

  <h2><a name="Saving_a_File" id="Saving_a_File">Saving
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo is "intelligent" about saving files. For example,
  Komodo prompts to save unsaved files on close. Attempting to save
  changes to a file that is set to read-only displays a dialog box
  where you are given the option to change the status or to "force"
  the save (which makes the file writable, saves the changes, then
  sets the file back to read-only). In addition, Komodo can be
  configured to automatically save a backup copy of files open in
  the editor. To configure Komodo's save functionality, use the
  <a href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#Save_Options">Save Options</a>
  preference page.</p>

  <p>To save a file with its current name, do one of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: Use the associated <a href=
    "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
    binding</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>File|Save</strong>: Use the
    <strong>File|Save</strong> menu option to save the file that is
    currently displayed in the editor. To save the file to a
    different name, select <strong>File|Save As</strong>. To save
    all open files, select <strong>File|Save All</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Standard Toolbar</strong>: Click the Save button on
    the Standard toolbar. To save all open files, click the Save
    All button.</li>

    <li><strong>File Tab Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    file tab and select <strong>Save</strong>. To save the file to
    a different name, select <strong>File|Save As</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="Saving_Files_Remotely" id=
  "Saving_Files_Remotely">Saving Files Remotely</a></h3>

  <p>To save a copy of the current file to a remote server, select
  <strong>File|Save Remotely As</strong>. The <a href=
  "#Opening_Remote_Files">Remote File</a> dialog box is displayed.
  When editing files located on a remote server (including remote
  files stored in a <a href=
  "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>), saving the
  file automatically saves it to the remote location.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_showunsaved" id="files_showunsaved">Show
  Unsaved Changes</a></h3>

  <p>Before saving a file, view the changes in the file since it
  was last saved by using the <strong>Show Unsaved Changes</strong>
  option. To invoke this option, right-click within the editor (or
  on the file tab above the editor) and select <strong>Show Unsaved
  Changes</strong>. An external window displays the differences
  between the current version of the file and the disk version
  (e.g., the version that was last saved).</p>

  <p>The unique characteristics of each file are displayed in
  different colors (red and blue by default); common
  characteristics are displayed in a third color (black by
  default). To configure custom colors for the "diff" window, alter
  the <strong>Language-Specific Coloring</strong> setting for the
  <strong>Other|Diff</strong> language in the <a class="doc" href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#lang_specific">Fonts and Colors</a>
  preference.</p>

  <h2><a name="Revert_File" id="Revert_File">Reverting
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>To abandon changes made to a file since it was last saved, but
  leave the file open in the editor, select
  <strong>File|Revert</strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Closing_Files" id="Closing_Files">Closing
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>To close one or more files, use one of the following
  methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: Select
    <strong>File|Close</strong> or <strong>Window|Close</strong>.
    To close all open files, select <strong>Windows|Close
    All</strong>.</li>
