  <h1><a name="tabstops_top" id="tabstops_top">Tab Stops</a></h1>
    
  <p>Tab Stop/Replace markers ("&laquo;&raquo;") are used in <a href=
  "komodo-doc-snippets.html#snippets_top">snippets</a> and <a href=
  "komodo-doc-templates.html#templates_top">templates</a> as placeholders for
  inserting content. They change the behavior of the Tab key when they are
  present.</p>
  
  <p>The markers have the following format in a snippet or template:</p>
  
  <pre class="code">
[[%tabstop:<em>name</em>]]
</pre>

  <p>When the snippet is used or a new file is created from the
  template, the marker looks like this:</p>
  <pre class="code">
&laquo;<em>name</em>&raquo;
</pre>

  <p>The "<em>name</em>" between the chevron characters ("&laquo;" and
  "&raquo;") is the default value of the marker. It can be set to any
  string (see examples below).</p>

  <p>After the snippet is inserted, "Tab" will jump to and select
  the first marker it finds. The marker can be replaced with text
  at this point, or left as the default value. Hitting "Tab" again
  replaces the marker and all subsequent markers with the same
  value with the replacement text or default value.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of a "blank" PHP function snippet that uses
  Tab Stop/Replace markers:</p>
  <pre class="code">
/*
    * function &laquo;name&raquo;
    * @param $&laquo;arg&raquo;
*/

function &laquo;name&raquo;($&laquo;arg&raquo;) {
  &laquo;&raquo;
}
</pre>

  <p>The &laquo;name&raquo; marker is the first place "Tab" will stop. It gets
  replaced with the function name which is propagated through the
  rest of the snippet when "Tab" is hit again. The &laquo;arg&raquo; marker is
  the next place "Tab" stops, and is treated the same way.</p>

  <p>It is useful to leave the cursor in the snippet window
  immediately before the first Tab Stop/Replace marker and select
  <strong>Maintain selected text or cursor position after
  insertion</strong>. If the cursor is left at the end of the
  snippet, "Tab" will not encounter the markers.</p>

  <p>Here's another example of a short snippet for HTML:</p>
  <pre class="code">
&lt;&laquo;div&raquo;&gt;[[%s]]&lt;/&laquo;div&raquo;&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The current selection is wrapped in an element (a "div" by
  default). Hitting "Tab" after insertion will select the first
  "div" for replacement. If it is replaced, the closing tag will be
  changed when "Tab" is hit again. If it is not replaced, "div"
  will be used as the element type.</p>
