  Folders</a></h1>

  <div class="right-float-box">
    <p><strong>Feature Showcase</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>import a <a href=
      "tutorial/tourlet_filesys.html#filesys_top">filesystem
      layout</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>Komodo has two distinct types of folders that can be used in
  projects or in the Toolbox:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Live Folders</strong> correspond to actual
      directories on the filesystem. The directory tree view
      displays the current contents of the corresponding filesystem
      directory.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Virtual Folders</strong> do not directly
      correspond to directories on the filesystem. They are
      multi-purpose containers; any component that can be added to
      a project or the Toolbox can be stored in these folders.</p>

      <p>When you <a href=
      "project.html#project_impcomp">Import from File
      System</a>, the virtual <a href=
      "project.html#project_top">project</a> or <a href=
      "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> folders are
      created with the same names as the imported directories, but
      modifying the name of the folder within Komodo has no effect
      on the directory's name in the file system. See <a href=
      "project.html#project_add_comp">Adding Components
      to Projects</a> or <a href=
      "toolbox.html#toolbox_addcomp">Adding Components
      to the Toolbox</a> for instructions on adding folders.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Double-click a folder to display its contents. Double-click
  again to collapse a folder and hide its contents. Alternatively,
  click the plus and minus icons.</p>

  <h2><a name="folders_options" id="folders_options">Folder
  Options</a></h2>

  <p>To access options for the selected folder, do one of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Toolbox or
    Project|<em>component_name</em>|<em>option</em></strong>: When
    a component is selected in the Project Tab or Toolbox, use the
    <strong>Project</strong> or <strong>Toolbox</strong> drop-down
    menus to access the list of options. The name of the component
    that is currently selected in a project or the Toolbox is
    displayed in the drop-down menu.</li>

    <li><strong>Context Menu</strong>: Right-click an existing
    component in a project or the Toolbox and select the desired
    option.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following options are available for folders:</p>

  <h3><a name="folders_importfs" id="folders_importfs">Import from
  File System</a></h3>

  <p>This option imports the files and directories from a local or
  network filesystem into a <strong>Virtual Folder</strong>.
  Depending on the configuration of the options below, file and
  directory references are created in the same hierarchical
  structure as the filesystem. (Alternatively, all the file
  references in a recursive directory structure can be located at
  the same level within a folder.)</p>

  <p>Use the following options on the Import from File System
  dialog box to configure the import:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Directory to import from</strong>: Specify the
    directory from which you want to import files. Use the
    <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate the file
    system.</li>

    <li><strong>Files to include</strong>: Specify the filenames to
    include. Use wildcards ("*" and "?") to specify groups of
    files. Separate multiple file specifications with semicolons.
    If the field is left blank, all files in the specified
    directory are imported.</li>

    <li><strong>Files and directories to exclude</strong>: Specify
    the file and directory names to exclude. Use wildcards ("*" and
    "?") to specify groups of files. Separate multiple file
    specifications with semicolons. If the field is left blank, no
    files in the specified directory are excluded.</li>

    <li><strong>Import Subdirectories Recursively</strong>: Check
    this box to import directories (and files contained in those
    directories) located beneath the directory specified in the
    <strong>Directory to import from</strong> field. This box must
    be checked in order to specify the "Import Directory Structure"
    option as the <strong>Type of folder structure to
    create</strong>.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Type of folder structure to create</strong>:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Import directory structure</strong>: If the
        <strong>Import Subdirectories Recursively</strong> box is
        checked and this option is selected, Komodo creates folders
        within the project that represent imported directories.
        Thus, the directory structure is preserved within the
        project.</li>

        <li><strong>Make a folder per language</strong>: If this
        option is selected, imported files are organized into
        folders according to the language indicated by file pattern
        in the filename. File associations are configured in the
        Komodo <a class="doc" href=
        "prefs.html#File_Associations">Preferences</a>.
        Each folder is named after the associated language, for
        example, "Perl files", "XML files", etc. Files that don't
        correspond to a known file pattern are stored in a folder
        called "Other files".</li>

        <li><strong>Make one flat list</strong>: If this option is
        selected, all the imported files are placed directly under
        the project or folder from which the <strong>Import from
        File System</strong> command was invoked.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>After importing from the file system, you are prompted to
  confirm the addition of the files that match the specified
  criteria. You may remove one or more files from the import. Click
  <strong>OK</strong> to proceed with the import.</p>

  <p>After using the <strong>Import from File System</strong>
  feature, if you attempt to re-import the same file system
  location into the same project, only files that are new since the
  last import are imported.</p>

  <h3><a name="folders_opt_expack" id="folders_opt_expack">Export
  Contents to Package</a></h3>

  <p>Folders can be archived and distributed among multiple Komodo
  users via <a href=
  "project.html#project_impexp">Packages</a>. Packages
  are compressed archive files that contain the folder from which
  the <strong>Export Package</strong> option was invoked, as well
  as the folder's contents. Packages are stored in files with a
  ".kpz" extension, and can be opened by any archiving utility that
  supports <code>libz</code> (for example WinZip). The
  <strong>Export Package</strong> option differs from the
  <strong>Export to Project</strong> option in that a copy of
  filesystem-based components (such as files and dialog projects)
  is included in the archive. Conversely, <strong>Export to
  Project</strong> creates a project with a reference to the
  component's original location and does not create a copy of the
  component.</p>

  <p>To export the contents of a folder to a package:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Project Tab or Toolbox, right-click the folder
    containing the item(s) to be exported to a package and select
    <strong>Export Package</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the Package Export Wizard, enter the <strong>Package
    Name</strong> and <strong>Export Location</strong>. Click
    <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="folders_importpack" id="folders_importpack">Import
  Contents from Package</a></h3>

  <p>Exported packages can only be imported into "container"
  objects in Komodo, such as <a href=
  "project.html#project_impexp">projects</a>, the
  <a href="toolbox.html#export_import">Toolbox</a>, and
  folders within projects and the Toolbox.</p>

  <p>To import the contents of a package to a folder:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Project Tab or Toolbox, right-click the folder and
    select <strong>Import Package</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the Package Import Wizard, enter the name of the package
    and the location on disk where files (as opposed to internal
    components like snippets and run commands) will be extracted.
    Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="folders_opt_refstat" id=
  "folders_opt_refstat">Refresh Folder Contents Status</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>Refresh Status</strong> option checks read/write
  disk status for filesystem-based components (such as files and
  dialogs) contained within the folder. If a file is of a language
  for which "code intelligence" is supported and enabled (as
  configured in the <a href="prefs.html#code_intel">Code
  Intelligence Preferences</a>), <strong>Refresh Status</strong>
  will also update the code intelligence database with the contents
  of the file.</p>

  <p>If the component is stored in a <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> system,
  <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also checks the repository status
  of the component. Komodo determines whether a file is contained
  in an SCC repository by the following methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perforce</strong>: analysis of the client
    configuration</li>

    <li><strong>CVS</strong>: analysis of the CVS control
    directories</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="folders_add" id="folders_add">Adding Components to
  Folders</a></h3>

  <p>Use this option to add components to the selected folder. All
  components can be added to folders, in the same manner they are
  added to projects. Refer to the individual component
  documentation, or the topics <a href=
  "project.html#project_add_comp">Adding Components to
  Projects</a> or <a href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_addcomp">Adding Components to
  the Toolbox</a> for more information.</p>

  <p>Use the cut/copy/paste options to remove folders from a
  project or the Toolbox, or to move folders between the project
  and the Toolbox, between projects, or between folders.</p>

  <h3><a name="folders_opt_exproj" id=
  "folders_opt_exproj">Exporting Contents as Project File</a></h3>

  <p>When this option is invoked, a new project file is created
  that contains the folder (and its contents) from which the option
  is invoked. You are prompted to provide the name of the new
  project file and the directory where it will be stored. To open
  the new project file, select
  <strong>File|Open|Project</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a name="folders_opt_rename" id="folders_opt_rename">Renaming
  Folders</a></h3>

  <p>To change the name of a folder, select this option and enter a
  new name.</p>

  <h3><a name="folders_opt_scccont" id="folders_opt_scccont">Source
  Control on Folder Contents</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Source Control on Contents</strong> refreshes the
  source code control status of all the files contained within the
  folder. A subset of Komodo's <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">Source Code Control</a> functions
  can be performed. See <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">Source Code Control</a> for a
  description of specific options.</p>

  <h3><a name="folders_opt_del" id="folders_opt_del">Deleting
  Folders</a></h3>

  <p>To remove a folder from a <a href=
  "project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, select the
  <strong>Delete</strong> option. Deleting a Komodo folder has no
  effect on the actual filesystem contents. The folder is removed
  from the project or Toolbox, but not deleted from the disk.</p>
