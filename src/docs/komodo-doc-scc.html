  <h1><a name="scc_top" id="scc_top">Source Code Control</a>
  <span class="version_alert">Komodo IDE only</span></h1>

  <p>"Source code control" refers to the practice of storing files
  containing program source code (and other project artifacts) in a
  common repository. Using source code control (SCC), multiple
  developers can work on the same project (including the same
  project file) at the same time. The SCC repository can be queried
  for a detailed listing of the changes that occurred each time a
  file was edited. Files under source code control that are open
  for editing can also be reverted to their previous state.</p>

  <p>Komodo's SCC integration works in conjunction with the
  <a class="doc" href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>,
  <a class="doc" href=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> and <a class="doc"
  href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> source code control
  systems.</p>

  <p>Depots, repositories, branches, and projects cannot be created
  or configured from within Komodo. This must be done using the SCC
  software itself. Komodo's SCC features become available when
  files are checked out from the source code repository.</p>

  <p>From within Komodo, you can perform the following SCC
  actions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>add files to the repository</li>

    <li>remove files from the repository</li>

    <li>compare files in the editor against their repository
    versions (a "diff")</li>

    <li>show a revision history for a file</li>

    <li>submit files back to the repository</li>

    <li>revert files to their previous state</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Additionally, files under Perforce control are recognized by
  Komodo even when they are not open for edit. They can be opened
  via the File menu, SCC context menus (locations described below),
  or the <a class="doc" href=
  "komodo-doc-workspace.html#Toolbars">SCC toolbar</a>.</p>

  <p>Komodo is intended to work in conjunction with these SCC
  programs; it does not replace them. <a class="doc" href=
  "http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> and <a class="doc"
  href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> are useful
  tools for managing files under source code control from within
  Windows Explorer. Perforce provides <a class="doc" href=
  "http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/p4win.html">P4Win</a>,
  a graphical client for Windows used to view and manage files in a
  SCC repository.</p>

  <p>Komodo SCC functions are accessible from the following
  locations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Toolbox Context Menu</strong>: Right-click a file
    in the <a class="doc" href=
    "komodo-doc-toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> to access the
    <strong>Source Control</strong> menu options. Source code
    control functions can also be performed on Folders in the
    Toolbox; right-click a folder and select <strong>Source Control
    on Contents</strong> to access the menu.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Projects tab context menu</strong>: Right-click a
      file in the <a class="doc" href=
      "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">Project Manager</a> to
      access the <strong>Source Control</strong> menu options. SCC
      functions can also be performed on Folders in the Toolbox;
      right-click a folder and select <strong>Source Control on
      Contents</strong> to access the menu. Two source code control
      options are available from the Projects tab and Toolbox
      context menus:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Source Control</strong> applies source code
        functions to the selected file only.</li>

        <li><strong>Source Control on Contents</strong> applies
        source code functions to the contents of the selected
        project or folder.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Editor Pane</strong>: Right-click a file in the
    Editor Pane to access the <strong>Source Control</strong> menu
    options.</li>

    <li><strong>Filename Tab</strong>: Right-click the filename tab
    above the Editor Pane to access the <strong>Source
    Control</strong> menu options.</li>

    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: Select the <strong>Source
    Control</strong> option from the <strong>File</strong>
    menu.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <strong>Source Control</strong> submenu options are the
  same regardless of which method is used to access the menu.</p>

  "doc" href="komodo-doc-workspace.html#Toolbars">SCC Toolbar</a>
  at the top of the Komodo workspace. Refer to the command
  descriptions below for more information. The toolbar commands
  only apply to the file currently active in the Editor Pane.</p>

  <h4><a name="scc_menu" id="scc_menu">Source Code Control
  Menus</a></h4>

  <p>To access source code control functions, select
  <strong>File|Source Control</strong>.</p>

  <p>Invoke source code control context menus by right-clicking
  files or folders in the following areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="doc" href=
    "komodo-doc-project.html#project_top">Projects tab</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h4><a name="scc_output_tab" id="scc_output_tab">Source Code
  Control Output Tab and Status Messages</a></h4>

  <p>The <strong>SCC Output</strong> tab is located in the Bottom
  Pane of the Komodo workspace. As you execute source code control
  commands, such as editing or checking in files, details of the
  commands are displayed on the <strong>SCC Output</strong>
  tab.</p>

  <p>Error messages and warnings are also displayed on the
  <strong>SCC Output</strong> tab. Additionally, error messages and
  warnings are displayed on the status bar in the bottom left
  corner of the Komodo workspace.</p>

  <h3><a name="scc_commands" id="scc_commands">Source Code Control
  Commands</a></h3>

  <p>As described above, source code control commands are invoked
  from the toolbar, the <strong>File</strong> menu and the Source
  Control context menu. The following commands are available,
  depending on the context:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Add</strong>: Add a file from a designated source
    code directory on your local drive to the source code
    repository.</li>

    <li><strong>Edit</strong>: Check out a file from the current
    source code repository.</li>

    <li><strong>Revert Changes</strong>: Check the file back into
    the repository, abandoning any changes made since it was
    checked out.</li>

    <li><strong>Remove</strong>: Delete the file from both the
    source code repository and the corresponding local
    directory.</li>

    <li><strong>Update</strong>: When the local version no longer
    matches the repository version of a file, select this command
    to update the local version of the file.</li>

    <li><strong>Diff (Compare Files)</strong>: Compare the version
    of a file open in the Editor Pane with the version in the
    source code repository. Depending on the setting in <a class=
    "doc" href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#scc">Preferences</a>, the
    diff display is shown on another Komodo editor tab or in a
    separate window. If the display style for diffs
    (<strong>Edit|Preferences|Source Code Control</strong>) is set
    to <strong>Create new window</strong>, press 'F9' or select
    <strong>Jump to Corresponding Line</strong> to open and/or
    shift focus to the original file in the Editor Pane. If viewing
    a diff in an editor tab, right-click and select <strong>Jump to
    Corresponding Line</strong> to shift focus to the editor tab
    containing the source code. Selecting this option opens the
    source code tab in the Editor Pane if it is not already
    open.</li>

    <li><strong>History</strong>: Show the change history for the
    current file.</li>

    <li><strong>Commit Changes</strong>: Submit the file back to
    the source code repository.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Under Perforce, to open files for edit from within a Komodo
  project, you must first add files to the project using options on
  the <strong>Project</strong> menu. To accomplish the same under
  CVS, use the following procedure:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>At the command prompt, enter <code>cvs co
    &lt;projname&gt;</code> to open working copies of the
    files.</li>

    <li>On the <strong>Projects</strong> tab, right-click the
    project and select <strong>Import from File
    System</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the <strong>Import from File System</strong> dialog box,
    specify the location of the files to be imported and click
    <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm changes to the
    project.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="file_status" id="file_status">File Status
  Icons</a></h3>

  <p>If Perforce, CVS or Subversion is enabled in Komodo's
  <a class="doc" href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#scc">Preferences</a>,
  the status of files in the source code repository is indicated by
  icons that appear on file tabs in the Editor Pane and next to
  files and projects on the Projects tab.</p>

  <p>The icons can appear in a variety of combinations, depending
  on the status of the file and where they are displayed in the
  Komodo workspace. For example, a green circle next to a padlock
  on a tab in the Editor Pane indicates that the file is open for
  edit and that the version of the file in your local directory is
  in sync with the version in the source code repository.</p>

  <table cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="img/status_icon_add.png" /></td>

      <td>The file is being added to the source code
      repository.</td>
    </tr>

  <h2><a name="config_ssh" id="config_ssh">Configuring SSH Support
  for CVS and Subversion</a></h2>

  <p>Tunneling your CVS or Subversion connections over SSH can
  provide an added level of security for your repository access.
  CVS and Subversion use very similar methods for tunneling over an
  SSH connection. On Windows, download and install Putty or Cygwin
  to provide SSH support. Linux and OS X distributions typically
  include SSH support.</p>

  <p>This is a basic guideline for configuring CVS and Subversion
  to use SSH, however, because server configurations can vary, you
  should consult the documentation for the control system you are
  using, or request help from you system administrator.</p>

  <p>The use of Pageant (on Windows) or ssh-agent (OS X and Linux)
  with Komodo is strongly recommended.</p>

  <h4><a name="config_putty_install" id=
  "config_putty_install">Installing and Configuring Putty on
  Windows</a></h4>

  <p>Putty is a free SSH, Telnet and Rlogin client for Windows.</p>

  <p><strong>1. Install Putty</strong></p>

  <p>Download Putty (version 0.52 or greater) and associated
  programs from:</p><a class="doc" target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>

  <p>To connect to a server via SSH, the following programs are
  required:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>putty.exe</em></li>

    <li><em>puttygen.exe</em></li>

    <li><em>pageant.exe</em></li>

    <li><em>pscp.exe</em></li>

    <li><em>plink.exe</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ensure that the directory where Putty is installed is
  specified in your system's <code>PATH</code> environment
  variable.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Generate the Putty Key</strong></p>

  <p>Run the <code>puttygen</code> utility. Configure as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Set Parameters</strong>: Select either "SSH2 RSA"
    or "SSH2 DSA".</li>

    <li><strong>Generate Key Pair</strong>: Click the
    <strong>Generate</strong> button to generate the key pair.
    While the key is being generated, move the mouse pointer around
    the blank space to provide key randomness.</li>

    <li><strong>Enter Key Passphrase</strong>: Enter and confirm a
    passphrase for the key. Remember the passphrase - it is
    required later.</li>

    <li><strong>Save Public Key</strong>: Click the "Save public
    key" button and store the key in a file called
    <em>public1.key</em>.</li>

    <li><strong>Save Private Key</strong>: Click the <strong>Save
    private key</strong> button and store the key in a file called
    <em>private1.key</em>, in the same directory as the public
    key.<br />
    <strong>Note</strong>: The extension <em>.ppk</em> will be
    appended to the name specified (i.e.
    <em>private1.key.ppk</em>).</li>

    <li><strong>Copy Key Contents</strong>: Copy the contents of
    the public key field (at the top of the dialog box) to a file
    named <em>public1-openssh.key</em>. This key is required
    later.</li>

    <li><strong>Close puttygen</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3. Load and Configure the Putty Authentication
  Agent</strong></p>

  <p>Run the <code>pageant</code> program. This loads the Putty
  Authentication Agent into the Windows System Tray.</p>

  <p>Right-click the Pageant icon in the Windows System Tray.
  Select <strong>Add Key</strong>. Navigate to the directory where
  you saved the public and private keys in the previous step, and
  select the file <em>private1.key.ppk</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Configure Putty To Use Pageant</strong></p>

  <p>Run the <code>putty</code> program. Configure as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Specify Server</strong>: On the
    <strong>Session</strong> page of the Configuration form, enter
    the host name or IP address of the server.</li>

    <li><strong>Specify Protocol</strong>: On the
    <strong>Session</strong> page, in the <strong>Protocol</strong>
    field, select the "SSH" protocol.</li>

    <li><strong>Create Saved Session</strong>: In the <strong>Saved
    Sessions</strong> field, enter the host name again. Click the
    <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>

    <li><strong>Configure Connection</strong>: on the
    <strong>Connection</strong> page of the Configuration form,
    enter your username for the server in the <strong>Auto-login
    username</strong> field.</li>

    <li><strong>Configure SSH Protocol</strong>: On the
    <strong>SSH</strong> page of the Configuration form, specify
    "2" for the <strong>Preferred SSH protocol
    version</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Enable Agent Forwarding</strong>: On the
    <strong>Auth</strong> page of the Configuration form, check
    <strong>Allow agent forwarding</strong>. In the <strong>Private
    key file for authentication</strong> field, specify the path
    and filename of the private key created above
    (<em>private1.key</em>).</li>

    <li><strong>Save Session Information</strong>: On the
    <strong>Session</strong> page of the Configuration form, click
    the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>5. Store the Public Key on the Server</strong></p>

  <p>You must store the public key file generated in step 2
  (<em>public1-openssh.key</em>) on the CVS or Subversion
  server.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Open Command Prompt Window</strong>: Type
    <code>cmd</code> in the Windows Run dialog box.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Copy Public Key to Server</strong>: At the command
      prompt, enter:
      <pre class="code">
pscp <em>c:\path\to\</em>public1-openssh.key <em>username@server.com</em>:public1-openssh.key
</pre>

      <p>...where <em>c:\path\to\public1-openssh.key</em> specifies
      the location of the key file created in step two, and
      <em>username@server.com</em> specifies your username and URL
      on the remote server. You are prompted to confirm the
      legitimacy of the host, and may be prompted to enter your
      password for the server.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Connect Using Putty</strong>: If necessary, run the
    <code>putty</code> program. In the <strong>Saved
    Sessions</strong> field, double-click the configuration created
    in Step 4. This establishes a connection to the server.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Configure the Key on the Server</strong>: After
      logging on to the server, enter the following commands to
      configure the SSH key:
      <pre class="code">
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
cat ~/public1-openssh.key &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm ~/public1-openssh.key

</pre>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Log Off and Exit Putty</strong>: Enter
    <code>exit</code> to close the session of the server.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>6. Test the Configuration</strong></p>

  <p>Restart Putty. In the <strong>Saved Sessions</strong> field,
  double-click the configuration created in Step 4. You should not
  be prompted to log in. If you are, the configuration failed.
  Review the steps above and ensure that they were completed
  correctly.</p>

  <h4><a name="config_cvs_putty" id="config_cvs_putty">Using CVS
  with Putty on Windows</a></h4>

  <p>Use the following additional steps if you are using CVS with
  Komodo.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Check Out a CVS Module</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create Local CVS Directory</strong>: Create a
    directory to store a copy of the CVS repository.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Copy Files to Local Directory</strong>: At a command
      prompt, enter:
      <pre class="code">
set CVS_RSH=plink
set PLINK_PROTOCOL=ssh
cvs -d :ext:<em>username@cvs.server.com</em>:/<em>repository_name</em> co <em>cvs_module</em>
</pre>

      <p>...where <em>username@cvs.server.com</em> specifies your
      username on the CVS server and the URL of the CVS server,
      <em>repository_name</em> specifies the name of the repository
      on the server, and <em>cvs_module</em> specifies the name of
      the module in the chosen working repository.</p>

      <p>Login is handled by SSH. The files are copied to the local
      system. These environment variables do not interfere with
      non-SSH repositories.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Ensure that these variables are permanently configured in your
  system environment (for example, by adding them to the
  <em>autoexec.bat</em> file or configuring them in the system
  properties).</p>

  <p><strong>8. Using Komodo and CVS</strong></p>

  <p>Before starting Komodo, perform the following steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Set PLINK_PROTOCOL=ssh</strong>: In the user
    environment, set the environment variable
    <code>PLINK_PROTOCOL</code> to "ssh".</li>

    <li><strong>Set CVS_RSH=plink</strong>: In the user
    environment, set the environment variable <code>CVS_RSH</code>
    to "plink".</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Ensure Pageant Is Running</strong>: Run the
      <code>pageant</code> program to enable the authentication
      agent. Ensure that the <em>private1.key</em> is loaded.

      <p>You can also execute Pageant and load the key via a batch
      file. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
C:\PuTTY\pageant.exe c:\path\to\private.key c:\path\to\private2.key
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a name="config_svn_putty" id="config_svn_putty">Using
  Subversion with Putty on Windows</a></h4>

  <p>Use the following additional steps if you are using Subversion
  with Komodo.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Check Out a Subversion Repository</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create Local Subversion Directory</strong>: Create
    a directory to store a copy of the Subversion repository.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Copy Files to Local Directory</strong>: At a command
      prompt, enter:
      <pre class="code">
svn checkout svn+ssh://<em>svn.server.com</em>/<em>repository_path/module/</em> <em>local_path</em>
</pre>

      <p>...where <em>svn.server.com</em> specifies the server
      domain name of the Subversion server,
      <em>repository_path/module</em> specifies the path of the
      repository on the server, and <em>local_path</em> specifies
      the preferred location on your local system for your copy of
      the repository. The <em>local_path</em> can be ommited, in
      which case the local path is the last part of the
      repository_path.</p>

      <p>Login is handled by SSH. The files are copied to the local
      system.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Ensure that these variables are permanently configured in your
  system environment (for example, by adding them to the
  <em>autoexec.bat</em> file or configuring them in the system
  properties).</p>

  <p><strong>8. Using Komodo and Subversion</strong></p>

  <p>Set the following environment variables in <a href=
  "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Environment">Environment
  Preferences</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>PLINK_PROTOCOL=ssh</code></li>

    <li><code>SVN_SSH=c:/path/to/plink.exe -batch</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Specify the full path to <code>plink.exe</code> using forward
  slashes "/" or escaped back slashes "\\". The <code>-batch</code>
  argument is used to prevent plink from prompting for user input.
  You can specify a specific private key by adding "<code>-i
  C:/path/to/private_keyfile</code>". For example:</p>
  <pre class="code">
SVN_SSH="c:/path/to/plink.exe" -i "c:/path/to/private_keyfile"
</pre>

  <p>You can use the Subversion configuration file instead of
  setting the SVN_SSH environment variable:</p>
  <pre class="code">
[tunnels]
ssh = $SVN_SSH plink.exe
</pre>

  <p>This permits configuration of different connection types. The
  <em>config</em> file is located in the Subversion directory,
  typically inside the Application Data area of the user's profile
  directory (eg. C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application
  Data\Subversion). See the Subversion documentation for more
  information.</p>

  <p>If you use "plink = $SVN_SSH plink.exe" in the tunnels section
  of the config file, use "svn+plink" for your checkout url rather
  than "svn+ssh".</p>

  <p>Run <code>pageant</code> to enable the authentication agent.
  Ensure that the <em>private1.key</em> is loaded. You can start
  Pageant and load the key using a batch file. For example:</p>
  <pre class="code">
C:\PuTTY\pageant.exe c:\path\to\private.key c:\path\to\private2.key
</pre>

  <h4><a name="config_cvs_ssh" id="config_cvs_ssh">Configuring CVS
  with Windows/Cygwin-SSH or Linux/SSH</a></h4>

  <p>To configure CVS to use SSH, refer to <a class="doc" target=
  "_blank" href=
  "http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/howto/cvs-ssh/howto-cvs-ssh.html">
  http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/howto/cvs-ssh/howto-cvs-ssh.html</a>.</p>

  <p>On all platforms, create an environment variable as
  follows:</p>
  <pre class="code">
CVS_RSH=ssh
</pre>

  <p>CVS determines when to use SSH, depending on how you check out
  the modules. If you use the "cvs login" method with the "pserver"
  protocol, CVS does not use SSH, even if CVS_RSH=ssh is set in the
  environment.</p>

  <p>On Windows, also configure the cygwin SSH Agent as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open a cygwin shell.</li>

    <li>Enter <code>exec ssh-agent bash</code>.</li>

    <li>Enter <code>ssh-add</code>.</li>

    <li>To check out a CVS module, enter:
      <pre class="code">
cvs -d :ext:<em>username@cvs.server.com</em>:/<em>repository_name</em> co <em>cvs_module</em>
</pre>

      <p>...where <em>username@cvs.server.com</em> specifies your
      username on the CVS server and the URL of the CVS server,
      <em>repository_name</em> specifies the name of the repository
      on the server, and <em>cvs_module</em> specifies the name of
      the module in the chosen working repository.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Start Komodo within the cygwin shell as follows:
      <pre class="code">
<em>/path/to/komodo</em>/bin/komodo
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>After completing the configuration steps above, follow these
  steps to open Komodo with CVS-SSH enabled:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open a cygwin shell.</li>

    <li>Enter <code>exec ssh-agent bash</code>.</li>

    <li>Enter <code>ssh-add</code>.</li>

    <li>Start Komodo within the cygwin shell as follows:
      <pre class="code">
<em>/path/to/</em>komodo/komodo.exe
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="config_svn_ssh" id="config_svn_ssh">Configuring
  Subversion with SSH on Linux or Mac OS X</a></h4>

  <p>Subversion determines when to use SSH depending on how you

  <ol>
    <li>Open a shell.</li>

    <li>Enter <code>exec ssh-agent bash</code>.</li>

    <li>Enter <code>ssh-add</code>.</li>

    <li>To check out a Subversion module, enter:
      <pre class="code">
svn checkout svn+ssh://<em>svn.server.com</em>/<em>repository_path/module/</em> <em>local_path</em>
</pre>

      <p>...where <em>svn.server.com</em> specifies the server
      domain name of the Subversion server,
      <em>repository_path/module</em> specifies the path of the
      repository on the server, and <em>local_path</em> specifies
      the preffered location on your local system for your copy of
      the repository. The <em>local_path</em> can be ommited, in
      which case the local path is the last part of the
      repository_path.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Start Komodo from within the shell. Komodo inherits the
