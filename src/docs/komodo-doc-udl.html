  <h2><a id="udl_introduction" name=
  "udl_introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo includes a general-purpose lexer engine that loads a
  description resource, and walks it while lexing the buffer. It
  currently allows for up to five sub-languages, each of which is
  expected to be a member of a pre-defined family ("markup",
  "style", "client-side scripting language", "server-side scripting
  language", and "template language"). The format of these resource
  files is low-level and intended to be fast to parse, so we have
  provided a programming language that is intended to allow users
  to build lexers for their own programming languages.</p>

  <p>Currently these lexers allow for six-bit colorizing, meaning
  that both errors and warnings can be highlighted in the buffer.
  The lexer description language allows for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>specifying a set of keywords and folding conditions for
    each family</li>

    <li>disambiguation rules for each family (e.g. in JavaScript,
    when does '/' indicate division, and when does it start a
    regex?)</li>

    <li>constant strings and patterns to look for, and what to do
    with them</li>
  </ul>

    <h2><a id="udl_language-overview" name=
    "udl_language-overview">Luddite Language Overview</a></h2>

    <p>Luddite programs typically consist of a set of files, called
    modules. A well-designed Luddite program will contain one main
    file, that provides a name for the target language, and then a
    list of <code>include</code> statements that load the other
    modules.</p>

    <p>Luddite consists of a set of declarations, most of which can
    appear in any order, except for the initial "family"
    declaration. This is because some declarations are
    family-specific, and bind to the prevailing family
    declaration.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3><a id="udl_a-sample" name="udl_a-sample">A
      Sample</a></h3>

      <p>The <em>php-mainlex.udl</em> file defines the PHP lexer.
      It is a useful example as it uses one of each of the language
      families: markup (HTML), css (CSS), client-side (JavaScript),
      and server-side (PHP). It includes transitions from HTML to
      JavaScript, CSS, and PHP, followed by transitions back to
      HTML from each of these languages, and finally the main
      language modules.</p>
      <pre class="code">
language PHP

include "html2js.udl"

include "html2css.udl"

include "html2php.udl"

include "css2html.udl"

include "js2html.udl"

include "php2html.udl"

include "html.udl"
include "csslex.udl"
include "jslex.udl"
include "phplex.udl"
</pre>

      <p>Working from the bottom of the list towards the top, we
      have four core files that contain code to describe how to lex
      each language on it's own. Above those are files that explain
      how to transition from one language to another (e.g.
      "php2html.udl"). As rules are attempted in the order they're
      first presented, we normally need to test transition rules
      before we attempt internal rules, which is why the core
      modules appear at the bottom.</p>

      <h2><a id="udl_luddite-in-a-nutshell" name=
      "udl_luddite-in-a-nutshell">Luddite in a Nutshell</a></h2>

      <p>Luddite programs consist of declarative statements
      separated either by newlines or semi-colons. Comments start
      with "#" and continue to the end of line. Because it's a
      declarative language, the order of different statements
      doesn't matter, but the order of rules in the same group
      does.</p>

      <p>The Luddite compiler allows lists to be entered with
      minimal punctuation (i.e without quotes around strings, or
      commas between entries). However, the following words should
      always be quoted when declared as strings as they are
      reserved words in Luddite:</p>

      <p>Luddite is intended to work only with Scintilla. It is
      helpful to refer to the <a target="_blank" href=
      "http://scintilla.sourceforge.net/ScintillaDoc.html">Scintilla
      documentation</a> when writing lexers in Luddite. To reduce
      redundancy, you can refer to the names of colors by using
      either the full name, such as "SCE_UDL_M_ATTRNAME", or you
      can drop the common prefix, and refer to "M_ATTRNAME". A
      partial prefix won't work, nor will hard-wired numeric
      values.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><a id="udl_families" name=
      "udl_families">Families</a></h2>

      <p>Most lexer components need to declare which language
      family they belong to: markup, css, csl (client-side
      language), ssl (server-side language - usually JavaScript ),
      or tpl (template language). This last language is usually
      used by the server-side processor that has to determine which
      code is markup to be output "as is", and which is server-side
      code to be executed (e.g. PHP's Smarty and Perl's Template
      Toolkit).</p>

      <p>The default family is "markup". You can write a lexer for
      any language that lives in one family, and it won't look like
      markup. This is an arbitrary starting point that makes sense
      for most template languages.</p>

      <p>All directives in a file belong to the most recent family
      directive. When a new file is included, it starts off in the
      family at the point of inclusion. If a new family is
      specified, when the include-file is processed, Luddite pops
      to using the family that was current when the include
      began.</p>

      <p>There are currently three domains that are
      family-specific: keywords, named patterns, and look-back
      tests, which are used to disambiguate.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
family csl
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><a id="udl_styles" name="udl_styles">Styles</a></h2>

      <p>For each family, we currently need to specify the style
      from scintilla.iface that the family will use.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
start_style CSL_DEFAULT
end_style CSL_REGEX
</pre>

      <p>This isn't surprising, as the code in scintilla.iface
      reads like so:</p>
      <pre class="code">
# Template: client-side language  # Start at 30
val SCE_UDL_CSL_DEFAULT=30
val SCE_UDL_CSL_COMMENT=31
val SCE_UDL_CSL_COMMENTBLOCK=32
val SCE_UDL_CSL_NUMBER=33
val SCE_UDL_CSL_STRING=34
val SCE_UDL_CSL_WORD=35
val SCE_UDL_CSL_IDENTIFIER=36
val SCE_UDL_CSL_OPERATOR=37
val SCE_UDL_CSL_REGEX=38
</pre>

      <p>A complete list of <a href=
      "komodo-doc-luddite.html#style-names">Scintilla Styles</a>
      can be found in the <a href="komodo-doc-luddite.html">Luddite
      Reference</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><a id="udl_keywords" name=
      "udl_keywords">Keywords</a></h2>

      <p>Most sub-languages have a set of keywords that we want to
      color differently from identifiers. You specify them using
      <code>keywords</code>, supplying a list of names and strings,
      which may be comma-separated, as in this code for
      JavaScript:</p>
      <pre class="code">
keywords [as break case catch class const # ...
          get, "include", set
          abstract debugger enum goto implements # ...
]
</pre>

      <p>The string "include" is quoted because it is a <a href=
      "komodo-doc-luddite.html#keywords">Luddite keyword</a>.
      Commas are optional, and comments can be added at the end of
      a line inside a list.</p>

      <p>You must generally specify a different list of keywords
      for each family, however it is possible to define some
      languages without keywords (e.g. HTML).</p>

      <p>Tell Luddite when to color a range of text as a keyword
      with the <code>keyword_style</code> directive. For
      example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
keyword_style CSL_IDENTIFIER =&gt; CSL_WORD
</pre>

      <p>A complete list of <a href=
      "komodo-doc-luddite.html#keywords">Luddite Keywords</a> can
      be found in the <a href="komodo-doc-luddite.html">Luddite
      Reference</a>.</p>

      <p>To prevent the color for an identifer from being converted
      into a keyword, use the <a href=
      "#udl_no_keyword">no_keyword</a> command.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><a id="udl_pattern-variables" name=
      "udl_pattern-variables">Pattern Variables</a></h2>

      <p>To specify how Luddite should process text, provide a
      string for it to match verbatim, or provide a pattern. The
      pattern syntax is nearly identical to Perl's regex
      language.</p>

      <p>Patterns for a particular language tend to be repetitive.
      To make it easier to use them, Luddite supports family-based
      pattern variables, which are interpolated into pattern
      expressions. These are the four pattern variables used in the
      JavaScript lexer:</p>
      <pre class="code">
pattern NMSTART = '\w\x80-\xff'   # inside cset
pattern CS = '\w\d_\x80-\xff'     # inside cset
pattern WS = '\s\t\r\n'           # inside cset
pattern OP = '!\#%&amp;\(\)\*\+,-\.\/:;&lt;=&gt;\?@\[\]\^\{\}~|'
</pre>

      <p>These patterns are interpolated into a character set. For
      example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
/[^$WS]+/  # Match one or more non-white-space characters
</pre>

      <p>The CSS UDL includes a more complex set of statements:</p>
      <pre class="code">
family css

pattern CS = '-\w\d._\x80-\xff'   # inside cset
pattern WS = '\s\t\r\n'           # inside cset
pattern NONASCII = '[^\x00-\x7f]'
pattern UNICODE = '\\[0-9a-f]{1,6}'
pattern ESCAPE = '$UNICODE|\\[ -~\x80-\xff]'
pattern NMCHAR = '[a-zA-Z0-9-]|$NONASCII|$ESCAPE'
pattern NMSTART = '[a-zA-Z]|$NONASCII|$ESCAPE'
</pre>

      <p>Pattern variables can nest within one another. You need to
      keep track of which variables define a character set, and
      which ones are intended to be used inside a character
      set.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><a id="udl_states-and-transitions" name=
      "udl_states-and-transitions">States and Transitions</a></h2>

      <p>The heart of every Luddite program is a set of
      state-transitions. The key concept is that states in Luddite,
      unlike most Scintilla lexers that are hand-coded in C, are
      not directly related to the colors that each character will
      be given. In Luddite you create your own names for each
      state, describe for each state which pieces of text or
      patterns to look for, and specify what to do with them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3><a id="udl_the-initial-state" name=
      "udl_the-initial-state">The Initial State</a></h3>

      <p>The HTML lexer starts with this code:</p>
      <pre class="code">
initial IN_M_DEFAULT
</pre>

      <p>The first statement means that we should start lexing at
      the state we call "IN_M_DEFAULT". Subsequent
      <code>initial</code> statements are ignored, without warning
      messages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3><a id="udl_specifying-state-transitions" name=
      "udl_specifying-state-transitions">Specifying State
      Transitions</a></h3>

      <p>To specify a state transition, provide a state block. For
      example, with HTML:</p>
      <pre class="code">
state IN_M_DEFAULT:
'&lt;?' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_PI_1
'&lt;[CDATA[' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_CDATA
'&lt;!--' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_COMMENT

# These are more complicated, because if they aren't followed
# by a character we want to leave them as text.

'&lt;/' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_ETAG_1
'&amp;#' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_ENT_CREF_1
'&amp;' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_ENT_REF_1
'&lt;' : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_M_STAG_EXP_TNAME
</pre>

      <p>When we're in the state we call "IN_M_DEFAULT" (Luddite
      turns this into an arbitrary number to be used by Scintilla),
      if we match any of the above strings, we first will have
      Scintilla color (or "paint") everything up to the current
      starting position the SCE_UDL_M_DEFAULT color (remember, the
      prefix is implicit), and then change to the state named to
      the right of the "=&gt;". The comma before "=&gt;" is
      optional, but advisable in more complex rules.</p>

      <p>The match strings may use double-quotes instead of
      single-quoted. Simple C-like backslash-escaping is used, such
      as ' and ", but not hex or octal escapes.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3><a id="udl_include-upto-and-eof-conditions" name=
        "udl_include-upto-and-eof-conditions">Include, Upto, and
        EOF Conditions</a></h3>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_M_PI_1:
'?&gt;' : paint(include, M_PI) =&gt; IN_M_DEFAULT
/\z/ : paint(upto, M_PI)
</pre>

        <p>The "<code>include</code>" directive for the paint
        command paints from the last paint-point, to the position
        we <em>end</em> at. Recall that
        <code>paint(upto,[color])</code> stops at the position we
        were at when we attempted to match the string.</p>

        <p>One of the advantages of this approach over a standard
        regular expression based set of rules, specifying the start
        and end delimiters, is that Luddite is geared to building
        editor lexers. When people are using lexers they often are
        typing at the end of the file. For example, if I was typing
        this code:</p>
        <pre class="code">
---- top ----
...
&lt;?somepi&lt;EOF&gt;

        <p>I would like the last line to be colored like a
        processing instruction, even though I haven't completed it.
        Luddite lets you do things to confound your users, such as
        choosing a different color for an incomplete directive at
        the end of file. However, most of the time, you won't want
        to do this. If all of the <em>first</em> colors in a state
        block map to the same color, Luddite will automatically
        supply that color for an end-of-file condition at that
        state. In other words, the '/z/'-condition is rarely
        necessary.</p>

        <h3><a id="udl_redo-and-lookahead" name=
        "udl_redo-and-lookahead">Redo and Lookahead</a></h3>

        <p>There are two main ways to to delay state transitions
        and colorizing in Luddite:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Perl-like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class=
          "pre">(?=...)</span></tt> lookahead test in a regular
          expression, which will match but won't advance the cursor
          into that text.</li>

          <li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class=
          "pre">redo</span></tt> command. In the following example,
          we modify our rules for recognizing processing
          instructions in HTML. If the "&lt;?" is followed
          immediately by "php", and then by a non-name character,
          we want to transition to the server-side family, which
          presumably implements a PHP lexer.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the HTML lexer, we rewrite the state blocks for PIs
        as follows:</p>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_M_PI_1:
/./ : redo, =&gt; IN_M_PI_2

state IN_M_PI_2:
'?&gt;' : paint(include, M_PI) =&gt; IN_M_DEFAULT
</pre>

        <p>Wait a minute, you say. That does just the same thing,
        and less efficiently than when there was just the one
        state. In fact, all state IN_M_PI_1 does is a so-called
        epsilon transition to state IN_M_PI_2 ("epsilon"
        transitions don't consume input).</p>

        <p>Go back to that sample at the beginning of this
        document. Notice that the "html2php.udl" file is included
        before "html.udl". This file is short, and is reproduced
        here without comments:</p>
        <pre class="code">
family markup

state IN_M_PI_1:
/php\b/ : paint(upto, M_OPERATOR), paint(include, M_TAGNAME), \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_DEFAULT
</pre>

        <p>Because "html2php.udl" is processed before "html.udl",
        its pattern will be attempted earlier. If the lexer finds
        "php" followed by a word boundary, it will then paint the
        leading "&lt;?" as a markup operator, paint the "php" as a
        markup tagname, and then switch to the default state in the
        server-side language family.</p>

        <p>If you write a Luddite program that ends up where two
        states do epsilon transitions to one another, the lexer
        engine will detect this. More precisely, if it notices that
        it has carried out 1000 consecutive epsilon transitions, it
        will move on to the next character. This shows up in Komodo
        as the rest of the buffer highlighted in a single color
        (remember the implicit end-of-buffer coloring).</p>

        <p>The <code>no_keyword</code> command is used to prevent
        identifier to keyword promotion when an identifier is
        recognized. This is useful for programming languages that
        allow any token, even keywords, to be used in certain
        contexts, such as after the "." in Python, Ruby, and
        VBScript, or after "::" or "-&gt;" in Perl. See <a href=

        "udl_pattern-syntax">Pattern Syntax</a></h3>

        <p>The Luddite syntax for patterns is very similar to
        Perl's. Only forward slashes may be used as regex
        delimiters, all the usual escaping rules apply. For
        example, JavaScript uses this pattern to handle single-line
        comments:</p>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_CSL_DEFAULT:
# ...
# Swallow to end-of-line
/\/\/.*/ : paint(upto, CSL_DEFAULT), paint(include, CSL_COMMENT)
</pre>

        <p>If no target state is specified, the lexer will stay in
        the current state.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3><a id="udl_pushing-states" name=
        "udl_pushing-states">Pushing States</a></h3>

        <p>In many languages you need to push one state, transition
        to another, and at some point return to the previous state.
        There are many examples where this comes up in
        template-based languages.</p>

        <p>In most Smarty files, you transition from HTML to Smarty
        on "{", and transition back on "}". But if you find an
        open-brace while processing Smarty code, you should allow
        for a matching "}".</p>

        <p>In RHTML, the delimiters "&lt;%=" and "%&gt;" are used
        to transition from HTML into a Ruby expression, and back.
        These delimiters can occur in many different parts of HTML
        files, including attribute strings and content. The lexer
        needs to be told which state to return to when it finishes
        processing the Ruby expression.</p>

        <p>In Ruby proper, you can interpolate arbitrary amounts of
        Ruby code inside double-quoted strings between "#{" and
        "}". By pushing a state when you find "#{" in a Ruby
        string, you can allow for multiple nested pairs of braces
        in the expression, and return to the string when the
        matching "}" is reached.</p>

        <p>The Luddite code for expressing this is simple. Let's
        look at how it's expressed for double-quoted strings in
        Ruby:</p>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_SSL_DEFAULT:
#...
'"' : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_SSL_DSTRING
#... Note the redo here for things that could be operators
/[$OP]/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), redo, =&gt; IN_SSL_OP1
#...

state IN_SSL_DSTRING:
'#{' : paint(include, SSL_STRING), spush_check(IN_SSL_DSTRING), \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_DEFAULT
...

state IN_SSL_OP1:
'{' : paint(include, SSL_OPERATOR), spush_check(IN_SSL_DEFAULT) \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_DEFAULT
'}' : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), paint(include, SSL_OPERATOR), \
  spop_check, =&gt; IN_SSL_DEFAULT
# ...
</pre>

        <p>When we find "#{" while processing a double-quoted
        string, we push the state we want to return to
        (IN_SSL_DSTRING), and transition to the default Ruby state
        (IN_SSL_DEFAULT), where we lex an expression.</p>

        <p>If we find an open-brace while looking for operators, we
        again push the default state on the stack.</p>

        <p>To handle a close-brace, we carry out a "spop_check"
        test. If there's something on the stack, we pop it and
        transition to the state it specified. Otherwise, we
        transition to the specified state. If users never made
        mistakes, you would never need to specify a target state in
        a directive containing an "spop" command. But because
        people are capable of typing things like:</p>
        <pre class="code">
  cmd {
    yield
  }
</pre>

        <p>...we need to tell Luddite what to do on the extra
        close-brace.</p>

        <h3><a id="udl_line_oriented_transitions" name=
        "udl_line_oriented_transitions">Handling Newlines</a></h3>

        <p>Some template languages use line-oriented embedded
        languages. For example, in Mason you can insert a line of
        Perl code by putting a '%' character at the start of the
        line.</p>

        <p>The simplest way to express this in Luddite is to put an
        <code>at_eol</code> command in the transition into that
        state. When the lexer reaches the end of that line, it will
        automatically transition into the specified state. For
        example, the Luddite code to express this for the above
        Mason example is here:</p>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_M_DEFAULT:
/^%/ : paint(upto, M_DEFAULT), paint(include, TPL_OPERATOR), \
  at_eol(IN_M_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_SSL_DEFAULT

        <h3><a id="udl_arbitrary_delimiters" name=
        "udl_arbitrary_delimiters">Supporting Arbitrary
        Delimiters</a></h3>

        <p>Some languages support arbitrary delimiters for objects
        like strings and regular expressions. For example, in Perl
        you can provide a list of words with the 'qw' construct
        (e.g. <code>qw/abc def 1234/</code>), and in Ruby you can
        use the '%' character to delimit a string (e.g.
        <code>%Q(abc(nested parens)def)</code>). You can express
        these in Luddite using the <strong>delimiter</strong>
        keyword.</p>

        <p>There are actually four parts to supporting
        delimiters:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Targeting an "opposite" delimiter, so that one of the
          four characters "[", "{", "(" or "&lt;" is matched by its
          closing character "]", "}", ")", or "&gt;" respectively.
          These pairs are hard-wired into UDL.</li>

          <li>Targeting any character as the closing delimiter.
          Alphabetic characters can be targeted. The only character
          that cannot be targeted is the "<code>\</code>".</li>

          <li>Matching a delimiter.</li>

          <li>Continuing use of a delimiter. For example, to
          support a construct like Perl's "<code>s,\\,/,g</code>"
          idiom, set the target delimiter to ",", match it, and
          keep it as the target for one more match.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This code shows how the delimiter-oriented keywords are
        used to work together. We'll walk through support for
        Perl's matching statement first:</p>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_SSL_DEFAULT:
# ...
/m([\{\[\(\&lt;])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), \
  set_opposite_delimiter(1), =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET
/m([^\w\d])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), \
  set_delimiter(1), =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET
# ...
state IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET:
delimiter: paint(include, SSL_REGEX), =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX_POST
/\\./ #stay
</pre>

        <p>The first transition matches one of the open-bracket
        characters in a grouped pattern, and sets the target
        delimiter to the opposite of the contents of the first
        pattern group. The <code>opposite_delimiter()</code>
        routine requires its input to be one character long, and
        returns its input if it isn't one of the opening
        characters. So the two patterns could be expressed with the
        one transition:</p>
        <pre class="code">
/m([^\w\d])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), set_opposite_delimiter(1), \ 
  =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET
</pre>

        <p>Handling a construct like Perl's substitution syntax is
        slightly more complicated because it can use various
        delimiters (e.g. s/foo/bar/, s'foo'bar', s#foo#bar#, etc.).
        Furthermore, if the character after the 's' is an opening
        bracket character, the full pattern can use either two
        pairs of bracketing delimiters, or non-bracketing
        delimiters, as in</p>
        <pre class="code">
s[find] {replace}
s&lt;first&gt;/second/
</pre>

        <p>White space is always ignored after the first pair. To
        encode this in Luddite we need several states:</p>
        <pre class="code">
/s([\{\[\(\&lt;])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), \
  set_opposite_delimiter(1), =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX2_TARGET1_OPPOSITE_1
# ...
state IN_SSL_REGEX2_TARGET1_OPPOSITE_1:
/\\./ : #stay
delimiter: paint(include, SSL_REGEX), \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX2_TARGET1_OPPOSITE_2
/\z/ : paint(upto, SSL_REGEX)

state IN_SSL_REGEX2_TARGET1_OPPOSITE_2:
/\\./ : #stay
/[$WS]/ : #stay -- assume we're in {...} [ ... ]x
/([\{\[\(\&lt;])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), \
  set_opposite_delimiter(1), =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET
/([^\w\d])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), set_delimiter(1), \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET
/\z/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT)
</pre>

        <p>Matching the second half is similar to matching the
        delimiter after the 'm'.</p>

        <p>The final part is handling constructs like the standard
        '<code>s/.../.../</code>' language. To do that we tell UDL
        to keep the current delimiter for another round of
        matching:</p>
        <pre class="code">
/s([^\w\d])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), set_delimiter(1), \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX2_TARGET1_SAME
# ...
state IN_SSL_REGEX2_TARGET1_SAME
/\\./ : #stay
delimiter: keep_delimiter, =&gt; IN_SSL_REGEX1_TARGET
/\z/ : paint(upto, SSL_REGEX)
</pre>

        <p>Often when a construct is bracketed with matching
        delimiters, the target language is smart enough to ignore
        inner matched pairs. For example, if in Ruby you were to
        write</p>
        <pre class="code">
puts %Q(first(middle)second)
</pre>

        <p>Ruby would write out the string "first(middle)second".
        To encode this in Luddite use UDL's built-in stack:</p>
        <pre class="code">
/%[%qQwWx]([\{\[\(\&lt;])/ : paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT),
set_opposite_delimiter(1), =&gt; IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED
# ...
state IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED:
delimiter: paint(include, SSL_STRING), =&gt; IN_SSL_DEFAULT
/\\./ : #stay
/[\[\{\(\&lt;]/ : paint(upto, SSL_STRING), \
  spush_check(IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED), =&gt; IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED2

state IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED2:
/\\./ : #stay
/[\[\{\(\&lt;]/ : spush_check(IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED2), \
  =&gt; IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED2
/[\]\}\)\&gt;]/ : spop_check, =&gt; IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED
/\z/ : paint(include, SSL_STRING)
</pre>

        <p>Finally, you've probably noticed that we put an
        end-of-buffer transition in many of these states. Notice
        that the final <code>IN_SSL_QSTRING_NESTED2</code> state
        actually does no painting in its other matches. Normally
        Luddite will look at the colors a state uses to determine
        how to color the rest of the text if it reaches the end of
        the buffer. If more than one color is used, or none is
        used, the Luddite program should specify a color. Otherwise
        it's possible that Komodo will repeatedly invoke the
        colorizer until something is chosen.</p>

        <h4><a id="defining_here_documents" name=

        Documents</a></h4>

        <p>"Here documents" are a convenient way of defining
        multi-line strings. Typically they start by defining the
        "terminating identifier", preceded by an operator like
        <code>&lt;&lt;</code> or <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>. The
        string starts on the following line, and ends when we find
        a line containing only the terminating identifier.</p>

        <p>The following Luddite code outlines how to add
        here-document processing to a language, using PHP as an
        example, where we assume a here document always begins with
        the three less-than characters followed by a name, then the
        end of line:</p>
        <pre class="code">
<![CDATA[
state IN_SSL_DEFAULT:
...
/<<<(?=[$NMSTART][$NMCHAR]*\r?$)/: paint(upto, SSL_DEFAULT), \
paint(include, SSL_OPERATOR), => IN_SSL_PRE_HEREDOC_1

state IN_SSL_PRE_HEREDOC_1:
/([$NMSTART][$NMCHAR]*)/ : set_delimiter(1), paint(include, SSL_IDENTIFIER)
/\r?$/ : paint(include, SSL_DEFAULT), => IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_1

state IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_1:
delimiter : keep_delimiter, paint(upto, SSL_STRING), => IN_SSL_IN_FOUND_HEREDOC_1
/./ : => IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_2  # Not this line

state IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_2:

/$/ : => IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_1

state IN_SSL_IN_FOUND_HEREDOC_1:
/[\r\n]+/ : clear_delimiter, paint(upto, SSL_IDENTIFIER), => IN_SSL_DEFAULT  # Got it!
/./ : => IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_2 # The delimiter continues, so keep looking
]]>

</pre>

        <p>In this example the keywords <code>delimiter</code>,
        <code>keep_delimiter</code>, and
        <code>clear_delimiter</code> all work together. After
        matching the delimiter, we retain it with the
        <code>keep_delimiter</code> action, and then test to make
        sure the delimiter is followed immediately by the end of
        the line. If it is, we clear it. Otherwise we return to
        states <code>IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_2</code> and
        <code>IN_SSL_IN_HEREDOC_1</code>, looking for a line that
        contains the terminating identifier, and nothing else. By
        default matching a delimiter clears it, so we need to keep
        it and then explicitly clear it. The following example
        shows why this is needed:</p>
        <pre class="code">

        "udl_disambiguation">Disambiguation</a></h2>

        <p>In both Ruby and JavaScript, sometimes a '/' is just a
        '/', and sometimes it's the start of a regular expression.
        Luddite's token_check directive directs this. For example,
        in JavaScript, to determine if a '/' is the start of a
        regex, and not a division operator, you could write a test
        like this:</p>
        <pre class="code">
state IN_CSL_DEFAULT:
#...
'/' token_check : paint(upto, CSL_DEFAULT), =&gt; IN_CSL_REGEX
</pre>

        <p>Note that the "token_check" directive is part of the
        test, not the action to perform. This states that if we do
        match, color everything before the '/' with the default
        color, and change to the regex state.</p>

        <p>What happens during a <code>token_check</code> test
        depends on the contents of the token_check block specified
        for the current family. In a token_check block, you look at
        the tokens to the left of the current position. Each token
        consists of a two-value tuple, containing its colored
        style, and its text. On each token, we can decide whether
        to accept the token (meaning the test passes), reject the
        token (meaning it fails), or skip the token, meaning we get
        the previous token in the buffer, working towards the
        beginning.</p>

        <p>Here's the JavaScript token_check block:</p>
        <pre class="code">
token_check:
CSL_OPERATOR: reject [")", "++", "--", "]", "}", ";"]

CSL_WORD: reject [class false function null private protected public
  super this true get "include" set]

# All other keywords prefer an RE

CSL_DEFAULT: skip all
CSL_COMMENT: skip all

# Default is to reject / as the start of a regex if it follows
# an unhandled style

#### CSL_IDENTIFIER: reject all
#### CSL_NUMBER: reject all
#### CSL_REGEX: reject all
#### CSL_STRING: reject all
</pre>

        <p>You can provide either a list of strings and/or names,
        or the "all" keyword. Here are the rules on defaults:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If a color isn't specified: reject all tokens of that
          color.</li>

          <li>If a color has only a reject list: accept all
          others.</li>

          <li>If a color has only an accept list: reject everything
          else.</li>

          <li>If a color has only a skip list: reject everything
          else.</li>

          <li>If a style has two of the lists, the missing one is
          the default.</li>

        section of the Preferences area, and specifying that Komodo
        should look for XML namespace attributes and doctype
        declarations to further determine which language to
        load.</p>

        <p>Authors writing UDL-based lexers for XML vocabularies
        can tap into this mechanism by using any combination of the
        <a href=
        "komodo-doc-luddite.html#namespace"><code>namespace</code></a>,
        <a href=
        "komodo-doc-luddite.html#public_id"><code>public_id</code></a>,
        and <a href=
        "komodo-doc-luddite.html#system_id"><code>system_id</code></a>
        declarations to specify which language Komodo should
        associate with a particular file, regardless of the actual
        extension of the filename it is saved by.</p>

        <p>For example, XBL (XML Binding Language) contains a
        combination of XML and JavaScript, and is widely used for
        Firefox extensions and Mozilla applications. These files
        often are saved with names containing ".xml" extensions,
        but they usually contain the following prologue:</p>
        <pre class="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE bindings PUBLIC "-//MOZILLA//DTD XBL V1.0//EN" "http://www.mozilla.org/xbl"&gt;

&lt;bindings id="koListboxBindingsNew"
    xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/xbl" ...&gt;
</pre>

        <p>Any combination of the following three declarations in a
        Luddite file for XBL will be sufficient to direct Komodo to
        load the Luddite-based XBL mode instead of the default XML
        mode:</p>
        <pre class="code">
namespace "http://www.mozilla.org/xbl"

public_id "-//MOZILLA//DTD XBL V1.0//EN"

system_id "http://www.mozilla.org/xbl"
</pre>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><a id="udl_compile-install" name=
        "udl_compile-install">Compiling and Installing</a></h2>

        <p>The Luddite compiler and sample <code>.udl</code> files can be
        found in the "Komodo SDK" directory within the Komodo installation
        tree:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Windows: <em><code>INSTALLDIR</code>\lib\sdk\</em></li>
          <li>Mac OS X: <em><code>INSTALLDIR</code>/Contents/SharedSupport/sdk/</em></li>
          <li>Linux: <em><code>INSTALLDIR</code>/lib/sdk/</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Simply place the SDK bin directory on your PATH and you should
        be able to run <code>luddite</code>:</p>
        <pre class="code"># On Windows
C:\> set PATH=<code>INSTALLDIR</code>\lib\sdk\bin;%PATH%
C:\> set PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.py
C:\> luddite help

# On Mac OS X
$ export PATH=<code>INSTALLDIR</code>/Contents/SharedSupport/sdk/bin:$PATH
$ luddite help

# On Linux
$ export PATH=<code>INSTALLDIR</code>/lib/sdk/bin:$PATH
$ luddite help
</pre>

        <p>Typically you would:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>author one or more <code>.udl</code> files,</li>
            <li>generate the Komodo resource files (the main such file is the
            <code>.lexres</code> compiled version of your <code>.udl</code>
            file) with the "<code>luddite compile ...</code>" command, and</li>
            <li>build a Komodo extension (a <code>.xpi</code> file) with the
            "<code>luddite package ...</code>" command.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>To install that extension, open the built <code>.xpi</code> file
        in Komodo.</p>

      <div class="section">

        <p>Sample UDL files can be found in the <code>udl</code>
