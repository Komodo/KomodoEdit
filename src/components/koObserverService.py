"""Komodo-specific nsIObserverService implementation to allow the
notify/observe mechanism to be scoped on an object.

Mozilla's nsIObserverService implementation (@mozilla.org/observer-service;1)
is a global thang. This makes it inconvenient to use to pass notifications
to a specific instance of an object if there are many of them. For example:
to notify a specific Komodo document that its encoding has changed via the
global nsIObserverService would require a global listener that would then
pass the notification onto the document instance. If, however, we have a
koObserverService instance attached to the document we can call
.notifyObservers() on it and only registered observers on that particular
document will be bothered by it.

Note: The suffix "Service" on koObserverService is a misnomer because it is
NOT to be used as a service, there must be one instance per user. I.e.
createInstance() must be used instead of getService().
